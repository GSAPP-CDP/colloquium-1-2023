## “Methods as Practices”

Computational design methods are not just tools or techniques alone, but rather comprise a set of 
unique practices that shape the way designers approach the world. The social, cultural, and historical 
contexts in which computational design methods are deployed show us that its methods are not neutral 
or objective, but rather shaped by the values, assumptions, and goals of the designers who use them. 
By viewing “methods as practices,” designers can better understand how these methods can be adapted 
to the different contexts of distinct environments. 

## “Practices as Methods”

Computational design affords a unique ability for its practitioners to readily invent new practices 
of their own by combining, adding, and adapting existing methods, and even co-opting from other 
speculative, established, or standardized practices.

## About the Program

Computation Design Practices is an innovative program for recent graduates and practitioners that extends and integrates
disciplines between architecture, data visualization, and urban planning—focusing specifically on computational design
practices for the built environment at multiple scales. It aims to pioneer new concepts and pedagogies for an integrated
multi-scalar and spatial approach to computational design at [Columbia GSAPP](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/). The M.S.CDP curriculum encourages critical and
creative engagement with spatial computational design as both method and practice.

An archive of student final projects from the program is
