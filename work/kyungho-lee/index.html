                <h1>the Spontaneous City and the impact of social media volatility</h1>
                <img src="./images/spontaneous_city.png" alt="seoul spontaneous city">
                <p>
                    The large part of the city has evolved organically without extensive centralized urban planning. Instead, 
                    it has been growing based on the natural actions and decisions of its inhabitants. In result, dynamic and 
                    flexible urban fabric became one of the characteristics of Seoul. The villas, high density low-rise residential blocks, 
                    are the most common building type in the organic urban fabric and today they take up almost 40% area of Seoul. 
                    When the villas corridors are adjacent to the urban attractions, the alley often brings in young creative enterpreneurs and transforms
                    into "hot places" in Instagram. 
                </p>
                <img src="./images/villas_alley.JPG" alt="spontaneous development in villas alley">
                <h4>Before and after the corridor gets popular in social media.</h4>
                <p>
                    Social media, particularly Instagram, has played a pivotal role in the commercial development of urban corridors. 
                    It has turned ordinary visitors into brand ambassadors, and through the power of imagery and social sharing, 
                    it has contributed to making these areas trendy, sought-after destinations for both locals and tourists.
                    The trends in social media became the number one factor for the success of bussinesses in the commercial corridors besides the rent.

                <h1>The pain point</h1>
                <img src="./images/stakeholders.png" alt="stakeholders diagram">
                <p>
                    Elements: Architect, Students, Teachers, Librarians, Builders, Design tools, Communication tools, Time, Budget<br>
                    Function or Purpose: The purpose of the systems can be elaborated in multiple ways. One, to spend more time on creative activity rather than laborious works.
                    Two, to improve the quality of design outcome by communicating design iterations with clients reflecting clients’ feedback more effectively.
                    Three, to make school library more aesthetically pleasing and functional for students and teachers to study and communicate each other’s ideas more dynamically.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="./images/feedback_loops.png" alt="system diagram with feedback loops">
                <p>
                    Feedback loops: There are both balancing and reinforcing feedback loops in the effective work-flows systems. Miscommunications with clients and builders
                    have negative effect on the systems' flow rate, however architects can learn from these trials and errors and develop their communication skill more quickly
                    therefore stabilizing the systems. Improvment in effectiveness of work-flows also leads to more projects and experience, which reinforce flow rate of the systems.<br>
                    Pain points: Usually the lack of budget and time is the most problematic pain points in proceeding architecture projects. It is hard to solve problems regarding budgets. So it is better to focus on
                    other major problems that are relatively easy to solve such as High fidelity in schematic design phase. By proceeding SD phase with low fidelity and gradually increase fidelity as design phase progresses,
                    architects can acheive effective work-flows.

                <h1>Gyeonglidan-gil, the rise and fall of the commercial corridor</h1>
                <p>
                    Gyeonglidan-gil is the typical example of the villas alley that went through the pain points above, drastic change in social media trends and the gentrification. Which leverage point can we tackle here with a digital tool?<br><br>
                    Leverage points: There are several leverage points to cause changes in system behavior. One, more effective communication and presentation tools lead to more feedback from users which result in better design satisfaction from clients.
                    Two, streamlined workflows from design to rendering and documentation remove repetitive laborious tasks, which help architects focus more on creative activities.
