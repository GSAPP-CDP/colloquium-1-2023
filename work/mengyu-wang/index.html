            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            <p>
              The system of heritage conservation aims to preserve historical sites for future generations. It involves historical sites themselves, visitor interactions, research activities, and policy decisions. Feedback loops, such as reinforcing or balancing loops, shape the system. Reinforcing loops occur when successful conservation interventions attract more resources and visitors. Balancing loops arise when negative impacts prompt restrictions for long-term sustainability.
              The frequency and delay of feedback loops are crucial. Rapid feedback allows for prompt adjustments, while longer delay loops require proactive measures. Identifying leverage points, such as policy changes prioritizing sustainability or community involvement, is essential.

            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              Architects and conservation professionals play a crucial role. They assess conditions, develop plans, and oversee projects, working with craftsmen and construction teams. Traditional techniques and materials are used for authenticity, with careful craftsmanship and attention to detail.
              The system of heritage conservation requires a delicate balance between preservation and accessibility. Overemphasis on visitors may compromise authenticity, while excessive restrictions limit engagement.
              In conclusion, heritage conservation is a complex system involving historical sites, feedback loops, architects, professionals, and construction processes. Balancing preservation and accessibility, utilizing feedback loops effectively, and engaging skilled professionals are key to preserving the significance and integrity of heritage sites.

              In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various industries, including design and architecture. One notable area of progress 
              lies in utilizing AI models to foster collaboration between professionals and the 
              general public. By acting as a bridge, AI can facilitate the translation of creative 
              ideas from non-professionals into a format that professionals can understand and implement. 
              This essay explores the significance of shared authorship in design and how AI models such as pix2pix GAN and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) contribute to this process. Through the examples of an interactive community park design platform and the DeepScope project, we will discuss how AI enables citizens to actively participate in the design process and enhance the quality of urban spaces.

              The Power of Shared Authorship: Shared authorship, which involves the collaboration between professionals and the public, offers numerous benefits in the design process. It empowers communities by allowing them to voice their ideas and actively participate in shaping their environments. By involving citizens, professionals gain valuable insights and ensure that designs align with the needs and preferences of the intended users.

            <p>
              The Role of AI as a Bridge:
              AI models such as pix2pix GAN and DCGAN act as powerful tools to bridge the gap between professionals and non-professionals in the design process. These models enable the translation of non-technical ideas into professional renderings, making it easier for professionals to comprehend and implement the concepts proposed by the public.
              a. Pix2pix GAN: The interactive community park design platform described in the research paper demonstrates the capabilities of the pix2pix GAN model. Through the platform, citizens can sketch their visions for the park using different colors, expressing their creativity without the need for technical skills. The model then translates these sketches into technical plan renderings, allowing non-professionals to visualize their ideas in a professional format. This translation process ensures that the collaborative design process becomes more inclusive and accessible.

            <p>
              b. DCGAN in the DeepScope Project: The Media Lab's DeepScope project takes a different approach, utilizing DCGAN and a Tangible User Interface (TUI) to facilitate real-time city prototype designing and visualization. By using Lego models, users can construct physical representations of urban design concepts. These Lego models are then processed by the DCGAN, which generates perspective renderings of the proposed designs. This tangible and interactive approach encourages citizens to actively engage in the design process and provides them with a clearer understanding of how their ideas can be realized.

              Fostering Creativity and Implementing Ideas:The implementation of AI models in collaborative design not only enhances the participation of the public but also fosters creativity. By leveraging AI to transform non-professional ideas into professional renderings, citizens can see their visions come to life in a tangible and visually appealing format. This process encourages further ideation and exploration, empowering individuals to contribute actively to the design of their community spaces.

Through the examples of the interactive community park design platform and the DeepScope project, we have seen how AI empowers citizens to actively participate in the design process, fosters creativity, and enhances the quality of urban spaces. As we move forward, embracing AI in design can contribute to more inclusive and innovative solutions, ensuring that the voices of all stakeholders are heard and respected.

            <h2>"DATA MANIFESTO"</h2>
            <p>
              To gain a deeper understanding of the cultural context and exhibition status of New York's museums and galleries, I will collect data based on various aspects such as their geographic location, floor space, historical age, and the number and provenance of their collections.
            </p>
            <p>
              These data can be obtained by visiting the Museum Alliance organization, the museum's official website and asking ChatGPT. Of these, the data from the official website is more accurate and instantaneous, but it is not fully accessible to the public, and the amount of data is too large to be quickly processed. The data given by ChatGPT is more abbreviated. Still, it needs to be more accurate and real-time, and its visualization can only be used for rough narratives, not for quantitative research and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2017 survey report by the American Alliance of Museums shows that museums still have many inequalities regarding gender, race, and collecting tendencies. Hence, the museum ecology embodied in these data continues to result from directional selection by the art-collecting community under the dominant system of Western male discourse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, these data are undoubtedly biased. When dealing with data in the historical and cultural realm constructed from narratives of inequality, we should always be wary of racial and gender discrimination and colonialism lurking in the data.
