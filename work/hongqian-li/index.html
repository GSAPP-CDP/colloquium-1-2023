            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            <p>
              The New York City Plaza Program is an initiative by the New York 
              City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) aimed at increasing the 
              availability of public open spaces in the city. System Function: Transform underused 
              streets into vibrant, social public spaces to to ensure that all New Yorkers live 
              within a 10-minute walk of quality open space. The elements of this system include the NYCDOT, community partners 
              (usually non-profit organizations), physical spaces (the plazas themselves), 
              and users. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              In the NYC Open Plaza Program system, the primary stocks are the 
              quantity and quality of the plazas.For the quantity stock, the inflow is the
               opening of new plazas, and the outflow is the closure of existing plazas. 
               Various factors contribute to these inflows and outflows. The opening of new 
               plazas can be influenced by increased funding, greater community engagement, 
               supportive policies, outreach initiatives, and improving public health conditions 
               following the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, policy changes, community opposition, 
               funding cuts, and public safety concerns can contribute to the closure of plazas. 
               There is a balancing feedback loop at play here: as the quantity of plazas increases, 
               if these plazas are not well-managed, it could lead to the closure of some plazas, 
               thus decreasing the overall quantity. For the quality stock, the inflow is the 
               improvement of existing plazas, and the outflow is their degradation. Factors 
               that can contribute to the improvement of plazas include good design, 
               effective management, inclusivity and accessibility, and well-planned events. 
               On the other hand, poor management and unjust practices can lead to degradation of plazas. 
               There is a reinforcing feedback loop in this aspect of the system: when the quality of 
               the plazas improves, it attracts more community support and funding, which can then 
               be used for further improvements, thus enhancing the overall quality of the plazas.

            In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized 
            various industries, including design and architecture. One notable area of progress 
            lies in utilizing AI models to foster collaboration between professionals and the 
            general public. By acting as a bridge, AI can facilitate the translation of creative 
            ideas from non-professionals into a format that professionals can understand and implement.
             This essay explores the significance of shared authorship in design and how AI models 
             such as pix2pix GAN and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) 
             contribute to this process. Through the examples of an interactive community park 
             design platform and the DeepScope project, we will discuss how AI enables citizens 
             to actively participate in the design process and enhance the quality of urban spaces.

            The Power of Shared Authorship: Shared authorship, which involves the collaboration between professionals and the 
            public, offers numerous benefits in the design process. It empowers communities by allowing them to voice their 
            ideas and actively participate in shaping their environments. By involving citizens, professionals gain valuable 
            insights and ensure that designs align with the needs and preferences of the intended users.

            The Role of AI as a Bridge:
            AI models such as pix2pix GAN and DCGAN act as powerful tools to bridge the gap between professionals and 
            non-professionals in the design process. These models enable the translation of non-technical ideas into 
            professional renderings, making it easier for professionals to comprehend and implement the concepts proposed 
            by the public.
            a. Pix2pix GAN: The interactive community park design platform described in the research paper demonstrates the 
            capabilities of the pix2pix GAN model. Through the platform, citizens can sketch their visions for the park using 
            different colors, expressing their creativity without the need for technical skills. The model then translates 
            these sketches into technical plan renderings, allowing non-professionals to visualize their ideas in a professional
             format. This translation process ensures that the collaborative design process becomes more inclusive and accessible.

            b. DCGAN in the DeepScope Project: The Media Lab's DeepScope project takes a different approach, utilizing DCGAN and 
            a Tangible User Interface (TUI) to facilitate real-time city prototype designing and visualization. By using Lego 
            models, users can construct physical representations of urban design concepts. These Lego models are then processed
             by the DCGAN, which generates perspective renderings of the proposed designs. This tangible and interactive 
             approach encourages citizens to actively engage in the design process and provides them with a clearer 
             understanding of how their ideas can be realized.

            Fostering Creativity and Implementing Ideas:The implementation of AI models in collaborative design not only 
            enhances the participation of the public but also fosters creativity. By leveraging AI to transform non-professional
             ideas into professional renderings, citizens can see their visions come to life in a tangible and visually 
             appealing format. This process encourages further ideation and exploration, empowering individuals to contribute 
             actively to the design of their community spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the utilization of AI models such as pix2pix GAN and DCGAN in collaborative design processes allows 
            for shared authorship between professionals and the public. AI acts as a bridge, transforming non-professional ideas 
            into a format that professionals can comprehend and implement. Through the examples of the interactive community 
            park design platform and the DeepScope project, we have seen how AI empowers citizens to actively participate in the
             design process, fosters creativity, and enhances the quality of urban spaces. As we move forward, embracing AI in 
             design can contribute to more inclusive and innovative solutions, ensuring that the voices of all stakeholders are 
             heard and respected.

              The dataset for this study is derived from the NYC Department of Planning's Public and 
              Special Meeting Disposition Sheets & Videos. I selected a most recent video from June 7, which focused 
              on the Madison Square Garden Special Permit. From this video, I extracted 500 evenly distributed screenshots 
              and employed an Object Detection and Segmentation algorithm (Mask R-CNN) to identify the number of 
              participants in the meeting. This approach provides a snapshot of public participation in 
              the planning process. My findings indicate that the average number of attendees in the 
              meeting was approximately 12. Interestingly, the screenshot with the highest number of individuals, 
              84 in total, was a perspective drawing of the project itself.

          I selected the disposition sheet PDF from the NYC Department of Planning and mapped its structure.
          I found that the document does not provide a space for recording public opinion, focusing instead 
          solely on the voting results of the planning commission. To explore how this could be made more 
          participatory, I utilized ChatGPT for suggestions. The AI proposed a more participatory version 
          of the sheet that could include additional sections such as a Public Opinion Section, Public Voting, 
          Decision Making, Community Representative, and Online Participation.

          I gathered public opinions from Reddit about the Madison Square Garden project, incorporating these perspectives 
          into the reimagined form. The feedback revealed several concerns about the project's impact on pedestrian traffic
           and local aesthetics. Respondents described the area around Madison Square Garden as chaotic, with heavy traffic 
           and incessant honking, which created a challenging environment for pedestrians. Safety concerns were also raised, 
           particularly regarding the compatibility of the arena with Penn Station. A prevalent sentiment was that relocating 
           the arena could potentially resolve issues associated with Penn Station. This viewpoint was echoed by Community 
           Board 5 (CB5), which, upon reviewing the application, determined that the Madison Square Garden Arena did not meet
            the findings of Article 74-41 of the zoning resolution. The board strongly advocated for the arena's relocation 
            as the preferred solution to address the multitude of issues surrounding Penn Station.

            with diagrams, making it easier for the public to comprehend. Additionally, it was teeming with 'messy' doodles and 
            sticky notes, each brimming with handwritten opinions. This creative chaos encapsulates the essence of public 
            participation, capturing a multitude of voices and perspectives.

            By analyzing the elements and structure of both Zoom meetings and physical meeting rooms, I observed uneven power 
            dynamics. In Zoom meetings, the maximum screen count is typically three: one for the representative speaking, one 
            for commission members, and one for the meeting's poster slide. In physical spaces, power division is more apparent, 
            with commission members seated on a pedestal and glass barriers separating people.

          To reimagine these spaces as more participatory, I engaged Midjourney. The results were intriguing. For Zoom meetings,
           one suggestion was an interactive board where participants can chat and share opinions. Another was a game-like 
           virtual meeting where attendees become characters in a city game. A simpler suggestion was to increase the number 
           of people visible on the screen beyond the current limit of three. For physical meeting rooms, the reimagined design
            featured a long table where community members could sit alongside commission members for discussions. This layout 
            promotes a sense of equality and encourages more open dialogue.
