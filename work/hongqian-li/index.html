            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            <p>
              The New York City Plaza Program is an initiative by the New York 
              City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) aimed at increasing the 
              availability of public open spaces in the city. System Function: Transform underused 
              streets into vibrant, social public spaces to to ensure that all New Yorkers live 
              within a 10-minute walk of quality open space. The elements of this system include the NYCDOT, community partners 
              (usually non-profit organizations), physical spaces (the plazas themselves), 
              and users. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              In the NYC Open Plaza Program system, the primary stocks are the 
              quantity and quality of the plazas.For the quantity stock, the inflow is the
               opening of new plazas, and the outflow is the closure of existing plazas. 
               Various factors contribute to these inflows and outflows. The opening of new 
               plazas can be influenced by increased funding, greater community engagement, 
               supportive policies, outreach initiatives, and improving public health conditions 
               following the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, policy changes, community opposition, 
               funding cuts, and public safety concerns can contribute to the closure of plazas. 
               There is a balancing feedback loop at play here: as the quantity of plazas increases, 
               if these plazas are not well-managed, it could lead to the closure of some plazas, 
               thus decreasing the overall quantity. For the quality stock, the inflow is the 
               improvement of existing plazas, and the outflow is their degradation. Factors 
               that can contribute to the improvement of plazas include good design, 
               effective management, inclusivity and accessibility, and well-planned events. 
               On the other hand, poor management and unjust practices can lead to degradation of plazas. 
               There is a reinforcing feedback loop in this aspect of the system: when the quality of 
               the plazas improves, it attracts more community support and funding, which can then 
               be used for further improvements, thus enhancing the overall quality of the plazas.

            In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized 
            various industries, including design and architecture. One notable area of progress 
            lies in utilizing AI models to foster collaboration between professionals and the 
            general public. By acting as a bridge, AI can facilitate the translation of creative 
            ideas from non-professionals into a format that professionals can understand and implement.
             This essay explores the significance of shared authorship in design and how AI models 
             such as pix2pix GAN and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) 
             contribute to this process. Through the examples of an interactive community park 
             design platform and the DeepScope project, we will discuss how AI enables citizens 
             to actively participate in the design process and enhance the quality of urban spaces.

            The Power of Shared Authorship: Shared authorship, which involves the collaboration between professionals and the public, offers numerous benefits in the design process. It empowers communities by allowing them to voice their ideas and actively participate in shaping their environments. By involving citizens, professionals gain valuable insights and ensure that designs align with the needs and preferences of the intended users.

            The Role of AI as a Bridge:
            AI models such as pix2pix GAN and DCGAN act as powerful tools to bridge the gap between professionals and non-professionals in the design process. These models enable the translation of non-technical ideas into professional renderings, making it easier for professionals to comprehend and implement the concepts proposed by the public.
            a. Pix2pix GAN: The interactive community park design platform described in the research paper demonstrates the capabilities of the pix2pix GAN model. Through the platform, citizens can sketch their visions for the park using different colors, expressing their creativity without the need for technical skills. The model then translates these sketches into technical plan renderings, allowing non-professionals to visualize their ideas in a professional format. This translation process ensures that the collaborative design process becomes more inclusive and accessible.

            b. DCGAN in the DeepScope Project: The Media Lab's DeepScope project takes a different approach, utilizing DCGAN and a Tangible User Interface (TUI) to facilitate real-time city prototype designing and visualization. By using Lego models, users can construct physical representations of urban design concepts. These Lego models are then processed by the DCGAN, which generates perspective renderings of the proposed designs. This tangible and interactive approach encourages citizens to actively engage in the design process and provides them with a clearer understanding of how their ideas can be realized.

            Fostering Creativity and Implementing Ideas:The implementation of AI models in collaborative design not only enhances the participation of the public but also fosters creativity. By leveraging AI to transform non-professional ideas into professional renderings, citizens can see their visions come to life in a tangible and visually appealing format. This process encourages further ideation and exploration, empowering individuals to contribute actively to the design of their community spaces.
