            <p>I'm driven by the potential of machine learning, computer vision, and data visualization in understanding urban human behaviors and perceptions. I've used computer vision to analyze New York City Planning Department's public meetings, gauging public participation. I also explored generative AI for enhancing meeting layouts. Another project involved creating AR plants that react to human facial expressions. Additionally, I've harnessed crowdsourced data to craft perception maps of New York City, integrating them with sky visibility and Citi Bike mobility data to delve into urban influences on human perceptions. Beyond these, I'm enthusiastic about HCI, interaction design, UX design, and tangible interfaces, aspiring to develop user interfaces that foster community engagement.</p>

                    <br>2. The meeting was structured as follows: Opening and Introduction: 11.2%; Presentation by the Applicant(s): 37.1%; Question & Answer (Q&A) Session: 22.4%; Public Commentary: <b>19.7%</b>;Conclusion and Summary: 9.5%;
                    <br>3. The number of attendees dwindled over time. The public commentary segment was positioned towards the end. The initial part predominantly featured presentations from the 8 applicants about the project and their requests, while the commission members primarily engaged in the middle portion during the Q&A session.

            <p>Due to the lockdowns and isolations caused by the pandemic, people are forced to work at home for extended periods, affecting many people's mental health. Moreover, as interpersonal interactions decrease, many people may overlook their emotional changes, exacerbating emotional issues. To address this, we designed an application using Augmented Reality (AR) and the DeepFace facial expression recognition algorithm. 
                Through user interaction with a virtual plant that mirrors their emotional state, users are prompted to be more attuned to their feelings. For instance, a withering plant signifies possible unhappiness, nudging users to care for their mental health.
                In the development of this application, we mainly used the DeepFace Python library for facial expression recognition and analysis. At the same time, to better showcase and test this application, we also created a video demonstrating how people can interact with it on various devices (such as smartphones, tablets, projectors), and experience the changes in the model and textures.
                Overall, we hope that through this application, high technology can help users better understand and care for their own psychological state, thereby improving the quality of life and work efficiency. This context has become increasingly relevant in the wake of the global pandemic, as more people work from home and face the challenges of isolation and mental health.
