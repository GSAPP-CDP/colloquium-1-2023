            <h2>the money bail system in the united states of america</h2>
            <p>
              The intended <b>purpose</b> of the money bail <b>system</b> in the United States of
               America was to make sure people show up to court. But the actual effect is that this
                <b>system</b> perpetuates the incarceration of people based on how much money they 
                have. While there are some states that have bail reforms, the money bail <b>system</b>
                 is the reality in the majority of the United States of America. After a person is 
                 arrested, they can either pay (an intentionally large amount of money) for cash bail
                  to leave jail or they must stay in jail. If they have the money to pay cash bail, 
                  they can decide if they want to stay in jail or pay that large amount of money to
                   leave. If they do not have the money to pay cash bail, they either must stay in jail
                    while they wait for their trial (which can be years), or they can pay a smaller
                     amount of money to a bail bonds company (a fee they would not get back even if
                      they show up to trial and are not charged), or they can plead guilty and give up
                       the right to a trial. These choices are influenced by if a family can afford
                        cash bail or to pay a bail bondsman. If the family pays bail or a bail 
                        bondsman, a poor family may be significantly impacted by paying this, while
                         a wealthy family may not at all. The money given to a bail bondsman will not
                          be given back, even if no charges are ever filed. The money bail 
                          <b>system</b> is unjust to poor people and the for-profit bail industry
                           profits off of this.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b>stock</b> in this system are people in jail. Most people in jail have not been 
            convicted of a crime. They are in jail awaiting trial because they could not afford to 
            pay the bail amount set for their release. (The median bail amount for felonies is $10,000,
             which is 8 months income for the average person in jail because they could not afford jail).
            </p>
            <p>The <b>elements</b> of this <b>system</b> are people arrested, jail, judges, courthouse,
               money, bail bondsmen, the law / statute / federal rules of criminal procedure, police 
               (arresting officers), lawyers, families, wealth, jobs (people may lose their jobs if 
               they have to stay in jail, and then they can no longer pay court fees etc), and investors in bail
                bonds companies. The <b>leverage points</b> are: how much money someone and their family has, if
                 their family can afford to pay bail, if their family can afford to pay a bail bondsman fee, if
                  they are able to leave jail and return home and return to work, if they can afford to stay in
                   jail for a long time and miss out on wages and caring for their families, if they can afford
                    a lawyer, the amount their bail is placed at.
            </p>
            <p>The money bail <b>system</b> is part of a larger <b>feedback loop</b> that works with 
              over-policing to keep poor people poor. That is, poor areas are overpoliced and so people 
              living in these areas are more likely to be arrested. Whether or not they are guilty or even ever
               charged, those that are arrested will have to either pay bail bondsman fee or pay money bail if
                they do not want to stay in jail for a long time (and likely lose their job and not be able to 
                care for their families etc). Staying in jail or paying these fees will have much more damaging
                 effects on poor families, making them even more poor. This feedback loop continues because poor
                  communities are over-policed, and it continues.</p>

<p>As bail bonds companies and their investors make more money off of this <b>system</b>, they grow in power and
   resources. As their power and resources grow, they are able to further lobby politicians to keep the money 
   bail <b>system</b> the status quo, despite that it is unjust. This is the reason for the <b>resilience</b> 
   of the the money bail <b>system</b>, despite increasing public awareness and outrage about the injustice of
    this <b>system.</b></p>

<p>The <b>hierarchy</b> is that the money bail <b>system</b> is a <b>sub-system</b> that plays a key role in the
   larger incarceration <b>system</b> in the United States of America, as it is responsible for a continually
    increasing number of people incarcerated in the United States of America, overcrowding jails and costing
     the country more and more money to keep them there.</p>

            <h2>lock-in, the money bail system continued</h2>

          <p>The money bail system creates a system where wealthier people are less likely to be incarcerated before trial than someone who is poorer and accused of the same crime. This system not only perpetuates inequality, but also contributes to that the incarceration rate and number of people in prison has climbed dramatically since the war on drugs, even though the rate of crime has been declining. Housing the ~500,000 people who are incarcerated pre-trial because they can not afford bail costs the United States $9 billion per year. Most of these people were accused of minor, nonviolent offenses. </p>

<p>So, if the money bail system is unjust and expensive for the United States, why does it continue? <b>Lock-in</b> is the phenomenon in which changing a specific software design is difficult because many other programs were designed to be dependent on it. While the money bail system is not technical, this phenomenon is still relevant. The money bail system is difficult to change because there are many independent groups with their own economic incentives to keep jails and prisons full. </p>

<p>These systems have historical roots. After slavery was abolished, southern states did not want to lose their free labor. So, they criminalized minor offenses in order to arrest those who had been freed so that they could be forced to work when they could not pay the fines for being arrested. This led to  convict leasing, a system of forced labor to provide prisoner labor to private parties. While convict leasing as in the post-slavery era does not exist today, incarcerated Americans still make good for American companies and get paid nearly nothing for their labor. There are also still private parties with incentive to lobby politicians to criminalize minor offenses beyond the many corporations that benefit from prisoner labor including private prison contractors, and those that sell clothes, food, and other equipment to jails and prisons. </p>

<p>In thinking about the future of the money bail system, flexibility is crucial for judges to be able to consider every person and their family’s situation individually. While locked-in guidelines for bail amounts based on what they are accused of could prevent bias on the basis of race or gender, it would prevent the judge from setting a lower amount for poorer individuals or for those who are clearly not a risk and are needed at home by their families. A better way to change the system would be to move away from money bail all together, because as ling as there are very rich people and very poor people in America, determining whether or not someone is detained pretrial based on how much money they can spend on bail, will never be fair. </p>

<p>The program author - Rules should exist that prevent bias and unfairness on the basis of race, class, gender, and sexuality. However, rules should still allow judges flexibility based on individual situations.</p>

<p>The masses author - Rhe masses should have an opportunity to impact policy more (not less) than lobbyists employed by comparatively smaller private parties with economic interests</p>
<h2>my authorship philosophy</h2>
<p>In terms of creating content, Authorship Models that resonate with me include the Yes Men, Youtube poop, Glitch Art, and Collage. The yes men raise awareness about problematic practices by corporations by using their privileges as white men to get themselves opportunities to speak on behalf of these corporations and do and say silly things or things to call out those problematic practices. Youtube poop mashes pre-existing media with subcultural significance to create new meaning. Glitch art uses digital glitches for aesthetic or activist purposes by manipulating data or software to break. Collage is making at from different forms to make something new. I like when the masses take the opportunity to hijack something that already exists that is a tool for capitalism. And when these hijacks begin to be used by capitalism, they should be hijacked. I think this allows the masses to gain power over something being used over them. </p>
