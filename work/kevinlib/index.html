            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
              For years, there has been a surge in discourse regarding how cities adapt to external crises that are at once a social, political, and environmental mess. These crises can occur at varying time scales and their responses can have varying degrees of public perception. For example, when the pandemic abruptly imposed constraints on indoor gathering and created stress on people’s social lives and the livelihoods of thousands of restaurants, New York City adapted by enabling opportunities for outdoor seating and transferring control of road and parking space from vehicles to restaurant owners. At a longer time scale, however, many New Yorkers criticize how the city has responded to housing in-affordability and the climate crisis. One solution that addresses both the housing crisis and climate change is the use of converting commercial to residential real estate. This use of real estate conversion can create desperately needed housing and avoid the need for new materials, resources, and energy for the construction industry, which is responsible for 40% of global energy-related Greenhouse Gas emissions.<sup>1</sup>

              Real estate conversion is interesting because it depends on many spatial, social, economic and political factors. In a system describing real estate conversion there are <b>elements</b> such as: building <b> stock</b> and its characteristics (legal/spatial attributes), capital (i.e. financial stock) and <b>stakeholders</b> (developers, investors, government/regulatory bodies, the public).

          <p>
          Additionally there are several subsystems that dictate changes and create flows in real estate conversion. First, to make a conversion happen there needs to be economic incentive or market demand for developers and investors - ex: pandemic causing high vacancy rates in an office building. Governments can influence market demand by creating tax incentives. On top of meeting economic incentive, a building needs to meet a slew of zoning and building code requirements. For example in NYC, every legal bedroom needs to have an operable window. This makes prewar office buildings more suitable for conversion because they were designed with operable windows (before air-conditioning was a thing) and are typically not as deep as modern curtain-walled office buildings. <b>Leverage points</b> can also be created at this point by making amendments to city zoning laws. For example, in 1961 residential floor-area caps and other requirements were waived for existing buildings (this was later amended to include lower manhattan buildings built before 1977). Even if a building meets all legal requirements, there are additional spatial or architectural considerations that may hinder a project and create delays. For example, the locations of structural columns and spacing between windows affects how many units can be built.

          <p>
          There are also feedback loops in real estate conversion in New York City. Political approvals need to be coordinated at state and local levels and across branches. A project may have support from the mayor and/or governor but get rejected at the legislature. Perhaps more prominently, projects need to have support of its neighbors and the public, post community meetings. For commercial to residential real estate conversion to gain traction in NYC, it surely helps to have more legal and architectural precedents to learn from.
