            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
              For years, there has been a surge in discourse regarding how cities adapt to external crises that are at
              once a social, political, and environmental mess. These crises can occur at varying time scales and their
              responses can have varying degrees of public perception. For example, when the pandemic abruptly imposed
              constraints on indoor gathering and created stress on people’s social lives and the livelihoods of
              thousands of restaurants, New York City adapted by enabling opportunities for outdoor seating and
              transferring control of road and parking space from vehicles to restaurant owners. At a longer time scale,
              however, many New Yorkers criticize how the city has responded to housing in-affordability and the climate
              crisis. One solution that addresses both the housing crisis and climate change is the use of converting
              commercial to residential real estate. This use of real estate conversion can create desperately needed
              housing and avoid the need for new materials, resources, and energy for the construction industry, which
              is responsible for 40% of global energy-related Greenhouse Gas emissions.<sup>1</sup>

            <p>
              Real estate conversion is an interesting yet complex endeavor as it depends on many spatial, social,
              economic and political factors. In a system describing real estate conversion there are <b>elements</b>
              such as: building <b> stock</b> and its characteristics (legal/spatial attributes), capital (i.e.
              financial stock) and <b>stakeholders</b> (developers, investors, government/regulatory bodies, the
              public).

            <p>
              Additionally there are several subsystems that dictate changes and create flows in real estate conversion.
              First, to make a conversion happen there needs to be economic incentive or market demand for developers
              and investors - e.g. pandemic and the shift to work-from-home causing high vacancy rates in an office
              building. Governments can influence market demand by creating tax incentives. On top of meeting economic
              incentive, a building needs to meet a slew of zoning and building code requirements. For example in NYC,
              every legal bedroom needs to have an operable window. This makes prewar office buildings more suitable for
              conversion because they were designed with operable windows (before air-conditioning was a thing) and are
              typically not as deep as modern curtain-walled office buildings. <b>Leverage points</b> can also be
              created at this point by making amendments to city zoning laws. For example, in 1961 residential
              floor-area caps and other requirements were waived for existing buildings (this was later amended to
              include lower manhattan buildings built before 1977). Even if a building meets all legal requirements,
              there are additional spatial or architectural considerations that may hinder a project and create delays.
              For example, the locations of structural columns and spacing between windows affects how many units can be
              built.

              There are some common pain points for developers in the conversion process (example to the right), but
              they may vary from project to project in terms of how much of a headache they end up being and how complex
              they are to solve. In some projects, profitability may not be such an issue, whereas in others, lack of
              community approval can bring the project to a halt.
              There are also feedback loops in real estate conversion in New York City. Political approvals need to be
              coordinated at state and local levels and across branches. A project may have support from the mayor
              and/or governor but get rejected at the legislature. Perhaps more prominently, projects need to have
              support of its neighbors and the public, post community meetings. For commercial to residential real
              estate conversion to gain traction in NYC, it surely helps to have more legal and architectural precedents
              to learn from.

            <p>
              Now that AI-generated content has become commonplace with the advent of services like chatGPT and
              Midjourney, we all have to think critically about how authorship should be defined with respect to these
              tools. Should content created by AI be copyrightable? Is AI-generated work original? Should credit carry
              over if AI is trained on copyrighted works? <br><br>These questions are most timely, even this week there was an
              article in the New York Times about the comedian Sarah Silverman suing OpenAI and Meta over the fact that
              contents from her books and many others were scraped illegally and used in training the two companies’
              Large Language Models.
              To address this, we first have to accept the reality that we are now just beginning to scratch the surface
              when it comes to using these tools in our everyday lives. AI tools and services are going to become so
              embedded in our workflows and everyday navigation that we might not even know that we’re using them. Even
              the concept of ownership and originality becomes a gradient depending on varying levels of involvement and
              support by these tools. Is an essay written with the use of an augmentation service like Grammarly still
              considered original while with chatGPT it is not? Where do you draw the line?
            </p>
            <p>There are various models of authorship that can be put in place. On one end, joint authorship agreements
              between the content creator and AI or party responsible for building/maintaining the AI is one option. On
              the other end, we put the onus of authorship entirely on the user author or “content creator”, and dismiss
              the involvement of AI on the basis of its non-personhood and fair use<sup>1</sup>. This is a challenging position
              because of our understanding that the AI has “locked-in” certain affordances in the user experience of the
              system that influence what may come out as output. For example, the user is limited by how the system
              interprets their prompts. That being said we need to consider who is involved as an author and when. If
              there is a person involved, e.g. the end-user who has the decision power to curate and publish the
              finalized content, then they need to bear responsibility for their content. If the content is published
              automatically and without curation, then perhaps attributing ownership along the chain of creation may be
              fair. (that is to both the user and system). <br><br> In any case, US copyright law should be reassessed because I
              think there could be new definitions of ownership devised to fit more appropriately with AI generated
              content. Perhaps, introducing a concept of “limited authorship” could work whereby users are considered
              authors but hold limited liability. In parallel, the companies responsible for the AI (e.g. OpenAI/Meta)
              would also hold limited authorship and bear some responsibility for content, like how Meta already reviews
              content on its platforms for abuse and hate speech. Lastly, there could be a model where AI-generated
              content would carry attributions in its metadata.<br><br>
              In the case of authors whose works are borrowed to train AI without their consent (e.g. Sarah Silverman
              case), I think that the companies responsible for the AI need to retrieve training data from legal
              sources, even if it hinders the scale or development of the training set. In the Sarah Silverman case, we
              learn that OpenAI and Meta use “shadow libraries” that have illegally scrapped thousands of books online.
              Perhaps the AI community can develop test cases to evaluate the legitimacy of each individual source.

              <p>Gathering data on commercial to residental real estate conversion practices in NYC.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="full">
              <p>
              The most helpful datasets so far have been news articles that describe the complexities of converting commercial to residential real estate, namely in the US. They offer brief interview quotes with developers and case studies of successful and pending projects. <br><br>The articles illuminate the myriad of policy, regulatory, and construction hurdles that come with a conversion project. While some of the articles go in depth into how older buildings are more suited architecturally for conversion, I haven’t found any literature so far on new design practices that emphasize use flexibility into the building design. In this sense, the reader is led to presume that most of the difficulty with conversion projects comes with getting legal approval and being in the right economic situation to incentivize these projects. Also interestingly, the news articles were often written from the perspective of the developer rather than policy makers, residents, or other stakeholders. They are framed as business ventures first, instead of design challenges or public interests. The politics underlying these news articles do focus on creating more housing while there are definitely others that believe that the main solution to vacant commercial spaces is to boost the economy and attract tenants or workers back to these places.
              <br><br>Other types of data that I’ve collected are zoning, land use, and tax lot data (PLUTO) from the NYC Department of City Planning. The news explained that one of the most complicated tasks in conversion projects is navigating the zoning and building code laws, especially in a city as large as New York. Architects and legal experts are often brought in at this stage for support. The land use and tax lot data collected corroborates this pain point as, from first glance, it is difficult to parse, but  contains a lot of information and is well geocoded or is accompanied by geographic files. That being said, this data was easy find as it was provided by the city, because presumably it is data that a lot of parties rely on early on for ground truth and consistency.
              <br><br>Another potentially useful dataset is the LIDAR model of the city which can be used to analyze useful characteristics that an architect or engineer might be interested in such as the floor plate, building depth, and window spacing and size. Of course this model doesn’t contain all the spatial details of each building, leaving out some necessary information such as column placement, but could be useful to start to eliminate buildings that don’t meet building requirements. This sort of spatial reasoning could potentially be supplemented by (google/apple) “Street View” images although there this would require some investigation to find street-view datasets that have coverage across the city. 
              I’m drawn to both quantitative spatial datasets such as zoning shapefiles and 3d models because they help to understand where potential projects might occur. At the same time, I’m also drawn to qualitative data such as interviews because these projects share many common issues, processes, and pain points.

          Some daydreaming around infrastructure and a future with uncapped growth led to this piece of design fiction where the excess used to support our excess is now defunct. Humanity has decided to give the vehicles used to move ourselves and our things around a second life. Subway cars and shipping containers are the building blocks of the city's expansions, filling open space between streets and buildings with new and modular vertical neighborhoods, yielding opportunities for residents to live, work, and play to their hearts' content. In this way humanity contines.
