            <h2>Whom does it impact?</h2>

            <p>
              The Function of the classroom system is to make efficient use of the space and equipment 
              and provide optimized interior environments. The physical environment will impact the teaching 
              behavior of the professor and the learning experience of the students. The purpose of the system 
              is to create vivid class interaction and maximize the learning experience.


            </p>

            <p>
              Students’ attention and participation are the stocks in the system. As time goes by, students’ attention drops, 
and their participation decrease. To arise students’ attention and get them involved, the professor may need to 
take breaks, switch to different teaching technics, ask questions, assign teamwork, etc.

            <h2>What are its leverage points?</h2>

            <p>
              In this system, there are lots of possible leverage points. Following are examples:
            </p>

            <p>
              
                <br>-	Removing all the tables in the classroom: Standing position is more flexible than seating position. Class can shift from lecture style to workshop mode, which will enhance the interaction on class.
                <br>-	Replacing the digital screens with sketch white board: The lack of multi media resource may hurt the attractiveness of the class, but may involve more body movement of the professor. 
                <br>-	The AC unit in the classroom stops working: room temperature increase by time. Hot temperature makes it hard to concentrate on learning and teaching. The stock of the system drops.

            <h2>Lock-in in technology</h2>
            <p>
              Lock-in in technology is a limitation and also an opportunity. Technological 
              innovation and deployment are path dependent and take place under conditions of 
              uncertainty. Technologies coevolve with supporting institutions, business strategies, 
              and user practices, and individuals, firms, and governments are subject to bounded rationality (Foxon, 2013).

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              Due to the characteristic of independence, technology needs to inherit and 
              adapt to what’s already established in the field. One obvious example is the 
              newly released Apple Vison Pro product, even though it is the most cutting-edge 
              AR/VR device, its functionality is established on top of the applications, programs, 
              sensors, and other technology and technical items already available in the market.

            The evolvement of technology over time determines that it is supposed to comply with diverse users, stakeholders, 
            managers, etc. Lock-in makes sure that the feedback and information transforming between different groups is smooth 
            and standardized. Take the NYC Open Data system for example, there are plenty of data contributors who publish valuable 
            data through the system. Researchers, policymakers, students, etc, are the majority of the people who benefit from those 
            resources. The standardization and management of those data in certain formate under a stable framework are the cornerstones 
            of storing, applying, transforming, and analyzing the data.

            <h2>Authorship in AI-generated work</h2>
            <p>
              The hybrid access and creative usage of AI or any technology tool make the authorship in them much more sophisticated than the traditional way of media, like books, newspapers, journals, etc. Considering the components of a technology tool, there are at least three major groups involved in the authorship:
            </p>

            <p>
                - The program developer: who comes up with the concept and lays out the framework.
                <br>- The user: who works with the framework based on individual demands and creativity.
                <br>- The data contributor: who is latent and massive, feeding the program with real evidence and materials.

            </p>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
            For instance, there are tons of website building and hosting tools in the market. They provide customizable website templates, components, etc to the users. The users edit text and upload images, videos, and audio to the website based on their project needs and their personal preference. And last, how do the tool developers create the tool? They might do some data collection and research on what style or components are most popular in web builders.

            <h2>Environment design affects learning-teaching experience</h2>
            <p>
              Well-designed classrooms can significantly enhance learning experiences by increasing attention span, improving intellectual efficiency, and restoring mental energy. However, with the shift from the traditional in-person classroom to hybrid learning, redefining the concept of a "classroom" and optimizing individual and group learning patterns have become major challenges.

            </p>

            <p>
              Sociological and environmental behavioral research has demonstrated the impact of built environments on various behaviors, such as territoriality, crowding, situational, and personal space. More recently, researchers have explored how the learning environment affects students. Consensus reveals that learning spaces exert physical, social, and psychological effects. A post-occupancy study conducted by the Steelcase Education Research Program investigated how different classroom designs influence student success and found that active learning classrooms positively impact student engagement.

            <p>
             In November 2021, McKinsey surveyed 600 faculty members and 800 students from public and private nonprofit colleges and universities in the United States, including minority-serving institutions, to assess the use and impact of various classroom learning technologies. The survey identified eight dimensions crucial for engaging effectively with students in higher education:

                <br>-Wide range of learning formats;
                <br>-Captivating experiences;
                <br>-Adaptive learning;
                <br>-Real-world skills application;
                <br>-Timely support;
                <br>-Strong community.

            <p>
            The pandemic accelerated the need for new and innovative online learning experiences, prompting institutions to reconsider their teaching approaches and focus on synchronous and hybrid learning. While the adoption of these eight dimensions varies among different institutions, they all contribute to building a strong learning community.

<div class="full">
  <h2>In the future we will need to grapple with environmental forces beyond ourselves, that are beyond the scale of the individual. How can we support each other through the dislocation, anxiety, uncertainty, isolation, and challenge of experiencing climate change?</h2>
</div>

<div class="full">
    <p>We are inventing a device that will help people relate to each other in the future. Specifically around moments where it will be hard to process the large, overwhelming, and complex manifestations of a changing environment.</p>
    <p>The device is informed by therapeutic modalities – we have designed it so that it can communicate and support the person wearing it, and help them connect with other people around them, in community with them, at work with them, in a lot of different settings.</p>
</div>

<div class="full">
    <img src="model01.JPG">
    <p>The device will be small, wearable, and can communicate through visual, sensory, and textual or spoken signals to the users with minimal input. It’s a support system that draws on concepts from family systems theory, somatic therapy, and group therapy, helping people connect and grapple with forces much greater than the individual, or self. There is a spiritual, yet non denominational, component to the device, in the sense that it helps people approach unanswerable questions about forces and systems that are sometimes frightening, chaotic and uncertain, and that operate at a global, planetary scale.</p>
    <p>One example of when we think the device would be useful: 
    <br>
    Earlier this summer the skies over New York City were orange, thick with wildfire smoke from forests burning in Quebec, Canada. It was surreal, and scary, and hard to grapple with. Many millions of people experienced it. People are affected differently by this kind of event – and it’s the kind of event that is only going to become more frequent in the future. Could a device that promotes group therapy concepts and connection to others experiencing the same event help? And combat isolation? And from new connections and ways of knowing, experiencing, and addressing emotions like fear, isolation, or uncertainty?</p>

    <p><b>HarmonyLink.</b> A device that works to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Combat Isolation:</b>When faced with unusual and frightening events, people might feel isolated and overwhelmed. The device can identify nearby users who are going through the same experience and facilitate impromptu support groups or virtual connections. Knowing that others share similar emotions and challenges can provide comfort and a sense of solidarity.</li>
        <li><b>Share Understanding:</b>Surreal climate-related events can be challenging to process and understand. The device can provide real-time information and educational resources to help users comprehend the underlying causes of such events, making them feel more informed and empowered.</li>
        <li><b>Introduce Coping Mechanisms:</b>Different people cope with extreme events differently. The device can offer a range of coping strategies, such as mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, or guided meditations, to help individuals navigate the emotional turmoil and uncertainty.</li>
        <li><b>Engender Collective Empowerment:</b>By connecting people who experience similar events, the device can foster a collective sense of empowerment. Users can share ideas, initiatives, and actions to address climate change collectively, strengthening their efforts to make a positive impact.</li>
        <li><b>Coordinate Climate Action:</b>The device can also act as a platform for organizing climate-related actions and responses. For example, it could alert users to local community events, clean-up efforts, or climate advocacy initiatives, encouraging active participation and collaboration.</li>
