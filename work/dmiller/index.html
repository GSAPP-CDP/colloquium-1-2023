            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            <p>
              The proliferation of location data has changed place and people’s experience of it. Commonly referred to as Points of Interest (POI), these data work through web maps and spatial media to
              become deeply embedded within the tools people use to navigate, understand, and situate
              themselves within the world around them. These tools, and the data, experiences, use cases, the places they describe, and the companies and actors that develop them are all elements that constitute a kind of platform, often describing itself as engaged in “location intelligence”. 
              I’m interested in describing contemporary, digital location intelligence platforms through a systems lens.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are many possible functions of location intelligence platforms, but they primarily fall under the directive of selling information about places, their specific locations, characteristics, how they are used, and how they relate to other places. The corporations involved in developing these platforms also tend to use language that dips into the humanistic and experiential, but it is not clear that “unlocking the power of places and movement, etc etc” has objectives beyond producing and circulating money across certain geographies.

              And while the sense and experience of places that comes along with being a body is rich, complicated, subjective, and impossible to fully reduce or capture into quantified terms alone, POI and their prevalence work to collapse notions of place, the experiences people have of them, the way people move through and between them into something that can be commodified, measured and analyzed and “ground truthed” computationally, with ever increasing frequency, remoteness, and automation. This is “location intelligence”: the measurement and valuation of location and locale in terms of how someone may spend time and money there. This intelligence is the stock, or product, of platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Corporations trade in these data, towards this intelligence, to influence and inform land use decision-making, design, strategy. These points are ingested by algorithms to fix rent prices and parameterize master plans. Now there is no place that escapes this capitalized lens on landscape. Place is consumed for consumers. This process is a kind of reinforcing feedback loop – places become quantified and understood  through location intelligence platforms and then in turn change, as subjects of the logics of the systems capturing and disseminating information about them in very particular ways. If using the data and using the places they describe are goals of location intelligence platforms, then use is a key factor in frequency, delays, and resilience of these platforms and their inputs and outputs.

            <h2>Location Intelligence Platform</h2>
            <p>A cartographic history of place-making?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              I do not want to take prevailing ideas about what constitutes “location intelligence” and its attendant systems or stakeholders as given. I’m excited about re-imagining them and shifting the relationship between stakeholders in the system, and the relationship between those stakeholders and the places (landscapes, locales, etc) that are the substrate and subject of location intelligence platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most of the design features and elements of location intelligence platforms that are locked-in trace their roots in the long history of European cartography. Which synthesizes and abstracts information in such a way that flattens place, controlling for risk, uncertainty, time. These maps, charts, and cadastres make space navigable and legible as a site for investment, extraction, ownership, “improvement” or “use”. Location intelligence platforms follow these logics, which also flow from centuries-old mapping practices through GIS technologies to their contemporary embeddedness within nearly all of the digital devices and networked tools in wide use today. 
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a deep body of critique within the discourses of critical and counter cartography that looks at the locked-in features of maps, and proposes creative alternatives that inflect cartographic output with different value systems, politics, and standpoints. From questioning the default projections, units and visual, representational systems of maps; to critiquing who makes them, uses them, and their motives. Authorship has been a site of intervention for critical cartographers, who have created many mapping projects that center user participation and input over default, top-down data creation or dissemination practices. These maps ask, who gets to say and share experience of a place? And thereby take part in (re)creating it?
            </p>

          <div class="half">

              "But while products are built on massive collections of check-ins, reviews, geocodable traces, and pings, users are not given autonomy, credit, or financial remuneration for their contributions to a platform."
            </blockquote>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              It follows that for location intelligence corporations, and the stakeholders that work for and are invested in their platforms, lock-in is essential. Place needs to be rendered into data, with standards and set features; which are in turn categorized, related, and databased. This pipeline of measurement and quantification of place increasingly relies on user input, or data derived from personal/individual use. But while products are built on massive collections of check-ins, reviews, geocodable traces, and pings, users are not given autonomy, credit, or financial remuneration for their contributions to a platform. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Much like the questions being asked of authorship and AI, which scoops up and re-represents massive amounts of information created under different authorship paradigms, the question of user authorship in location intelligence systems is complex and could be reimagined towards different economic and political outcomes (how credit, money, power, and place making capacity are distributed across stakeholders). Cultural geography would also say that landscapes are authored — what does this discourse on place making have to offer a critique of AI and location intelligence systems?

              I appreciate this project and how it seeks, curates, and represents geocodable bits of experience without categorizing and editing and flattening them. I wonder how the queer ethos of the project, which takes a different look at what place means to people, could also be applied to changing the defaults of the web map that underlies it — are there ways to queer projection, geocoding, zooming, tiling, and popups?

            <p>
              I’m interested in the spatial organization of Craigslist, where it chooses to abstract precise location and how wide ranging it’s many use cases have been over its history. The contribution of a listing, and how much information you may choose to add as an author of one, and then how the platform facilitates interaction with listings is fascinating to me — what does a landscape look like purely from the perspective of a site like this?

            <h2>Foursquare
            </h2>
            <p>
              Foursquare’s trajectory as a social media company to location intelligence platform turns on authorship – and the data generated by its users: from a social and somewhat playful way of relating to “points of interest” to a company offering spatial data and “location intelligence” as products based on that history of user participation. This model is representative of how other Web 2.0 social / participatory platforms operate – offer a social framework for use with surface level agency and benefits to the individual user, and in turn gather and sell data on their use patterns. What’s interesting for me to try to shift are not just the power imbalances (I check in on foursquare and get the social-digital benefit of that, but Foursqaure makes money on that check-in) but how digital authorship of and interaction with place could be mediated in an entirely different way.

              How do you author an experience? And how do you author a place? A visit to NYC, mediated by a model trained on massive amounts of media generated by millions of visits to NYC (66 million visited in 2019 alone) reveals patterns and limits in how places on a tourist’s itinerary are seen, experienced, and shared. Photos of NYC landmarks tend to look the same, and many visitors and residents likely have very similar experiences of sites like Times Square, but there are multitudes here, in the very same place, that may elude AI modeling – and they’re important.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each take on the ChatGPT-produced itinerary mirrors some of the limited avenues for authorship that tourists following an itinerary might face. What are all of the branching decision points within the very first prompt “Arrive in NYC”? What are the linguistic, class, racial, experiential intersections with what it means to “arrive” in a place that you’re visiting, especially one as complex as the city. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an algorithmic logic to traveling through NYC, and even more so by AI prompt. Sites have been made legible for selling and showing off the city for visitors for century, and they’re a vital part of what makes New York New York.

              <p>
                When is it necessary to craft data, to make or remake them, alongside the process of collecting, downloading, and gathering? I’m interested in ways of intervening in and expanding notions of “location intelligence”, in a digitized sense, and that will involve intentionally shifting what is considered default in spatial data. It will involve appropriating existing and widely utilized datasets, reading and analyzing them against the grain. It will involve looking to difficult- and /or impossible-to-map collections of information and regarding them as data, to test, explore, and learn from what they can and cannot measure, quantify and represent. It will involve making data and systems to archive and disseminate them that engender new political, aesthetic, and spatial possibilities. What if spatial data and the maps that represent them reflected the experiential, qualitative, and humanistic dimensions of place and space? 
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m inflecting my approach to data gathering with the work of Yani Loukissas and Johanna Drucker (among other data and media scholars, and historians of science and technology) who emphasize the importance of considering “data settings” (Loukissas) and that data are always taken or captured from a particular context, never given (Drucker). Data are only ever situated, partial, and constructed bits of information and are never whole, representative, or containing innate knowledge or factual bearing on their own. An approach to data gathering should reflect that.

              <h2>Methods Manifesto</h2>
              <p>
                Exploratory visualization resonated most with my practice, and the goal of developing alternatives to location intelligence platforms and systems. To me, this means not attempting to explain or predict using these data, but to question the underlying defaults of the data themselves, and explore towards alternatives. It means first learning about how the data are made, their limitations, and then developing arguments with them, against them, around them. Questioning the default settings with which these datasets are often visualized should also be a goal of my practice, and that’s where pushing the limits of the tools and methods used will be helpful, breaking down the rigidity of their particular data models to reveal something else. This process deploys exploration as a form of analysis — something more inductive. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I am also asking: can you learn through creative synthesis of seemingly disparate collections of information? By bringing these data together with others, there will be even more to explore and reveal about what constitutes digitized location intelligence.

          <div class="full">
              <p>We are inventing a device that will help people relate to each other in the future. Specifically around moments where it will be hard to process the large, overwhelming, and complex manifestations of a changing environment.</p>
              <p>The device is informed by therapeutic modalities – we have designed it so that it can communicate and support the person wearing it, and help them connect with other people around them, in community with them, at work with them, in a lot of different settings.</p>

              <p>The device will be small, wearable, and can communicate through visual, sensory, and textual or spoken signals to the users with minimal input. It’s a support system that draws on concepts from family systems theory, somatic therapy, and group therapy, helping people connect and grapple with forces much greater than the individual, or self. There is a spiritual, yet non denominational, component to the device, in the sense that it helps people approach unanswerable questions about forces and systems that are sometimes frightening, chaotic and uncertain, and that operate at a global, planetary scale.</p>
              <p>One example of when we think the device would be useful: 
              <br>
              Earlier this summer the skies over New York City were orange, thick with wildfire smoke from forests burning in Quebec, Canada. It was surreal, and scary, and hard to grapple with. Many millions of people experienced it. People are affected differently by this kind of event – and it’s the kind of event that is only going to become more frequent in the future. Could a device that promotes group therapy concepts and connection to others experiencing the same event help? And combat isolation? And from new connections and ways of knowing, experiencing, and addressing emotions like fear, isolation, or uncertainty?</p>

            Observation and Analysis:
            <br><br>
            During the scenario, the facilitator ensures that the "HarmonyLink" device provides supportive prompts, coping strategies, and messages of unity to the participants during the simulated wildfire smoke event in New York City. The facilitator also observes how participants respond to the prompts, engage with each other, and discuss their experiences during the feedback session. The goal is to assess the device's effectiveness in promoting emotional support, resilience, and community connection during the challenging event of wildfire smoke. The feedback gathered will help refine the "HarmonyLink" device to better meet users' needs in addressing the impacts of environmental challenges like wildfire smoke.
