    <h2>Design Fiction - HarmonyLink: Emotional Landscapes, Environmental Change</h2>
    <p>Klee, Mengxuan, Dan</p>

<div class="full">
  <h2>In the future we will need to grapple with environmental forces beyond ourselves, that are beyond the scale of the individual. How can we support each other through the dislocation, anxiety, uncertainty, isolation, and challenge of experiencing climate change?</h2>
</div>

<div class="full">
    <p>We are inventing a device that will help people relate to each other in the future. Specifically around moments where it will be hard to process the large, overwhelming, and complex manifestations of a changing environment.</p>
    <p>The device is informed by therapeutic modalities – we have designed it so that it can communicate and support the person wearing it, and help them connect with other people around them, in community with them, at work with them, in a lot of different settings.</p>
</div>

<div class="full">
    <img src="model01.JPG">
    <p>The device will be small, wearable, and can communicate through visual, sensory, and textual or spoken signals to the users with minimal input. It’s a support system that draws on concepts from family systems theory, somatic therapy, and group therapy, helping people connect and grapple with forces much greater than the individual, or self. There is a spiritual, yet non denominational, component to the device, in the sense that it helps people approach unanswerable questions about forces and systems that are sometimes frightening, chaotic and uncertain, and that operate at a global, planetary scale.</p>
    <p>One example of when we think the device would be useful: 
    <br>
    Earlier this summer the skies over New York City were orange, thick with wildfire smoke from forests burning in Quebec, Canada. It was surreal, and scary, and hard to grapple with. Many millions of people experienced it. People are affected differently by this kind of event – and it’s the kind of event that is only going to become more frequent in the future. Could a device that promotes group therapy concepts and connection to others experiencing the same event help? And combat isolation? And from new connections and ways of knowing, experiencing, and addressing emotions like fear, isolation, or uncertainty?</p>

    <p><b>HarmonyLink.</b> A device that works to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Combat Isolation:</b>When faced with unusual and frightening events, people might feel isolated and overwhelmed. The device can identify nearby users who are going through the same experience and facilitate impromptu support groups or virtual connections. Knowing that others share similar emotions and challenges can provide comfort and a sense of solidarity.</li>
        <li><b>Share Understanding:</b>Surreal climate-related events can be challenging to process and understand. The device can provide real-time information and educational resources to help users comprehend the underlying causes of such events, making them feel more informed and empowered.</li>
        <li><b>Introduce Coping Mechanisms:</b>Different people cope with extreme events differently. The device can offer a range of coping strategies, such as mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, or guided meditations, to help individuals navigate the emotional turmoil and uncertainty.</li>
        <li><b>Engender Collective Empowerment:</b>By connecting people who experience similar events, the device can foster a collective sense of empowerment. Users can share ideas, initiatives, and actions to address climate change collectively, strengthening their efforts to make a positive impact.</li>
        <li><b>Coordinate Climate Action:</b>The device can also act as a platform for organizing climate-related actions and responses. For example, it could alert users to local community events, clean-up efforts, or climate advocacy initiatives, encouraging active participation and collaboration.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Supporting people through events like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Extreme Weather Events:</b>In regions prone to severe hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods, the device can facilitate communication and support among affected individuals during and after such events.</li>
        <li><b>Coastal Erosion and Sea-Level Rise:</b>Communities facing coastal erosion and sea-level rise can use the device to connect, share experiences, and discuss adaptive strategies for resilience.</li>
        <li><b>Biodiversity Loss and Wildlife Encounters:</b>The device can facilitate connections among people who witness the loss of biodiversity or experience encounters with displaced wildlife due to climate change impacts.</li>
        <li><b>Water Scarcity and Drought:</b>In regions experiencing water scarcity and drought, the device can provide information on water-saving practices and encourage community water-sharing initiatives.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The device's ability to promote group therapy concepts, facilitate connections, and provide emotional support can help people process the emotional and psychological impacts of surreal climate change-related events together. By fostering a sense of community and shared purpose, the device can empower individuals to address climate change challenges proactively and collaboratively.</p>

    <br><br>
    (Text on screen: "Feedback") We value your thoughts on how the "HarmonyLink" device supported you during the simulated wildfire smoke event.
    <br><br>
    (The simulated wildfire smoke experience ends, and participants remove the "HarmonyLink" devices. The facilitator remains hidden, allowing participants to interact freely and share their experiences among themselves.)
    <br><br>
    Observation and Analysis:
    <br><br>
    During the scenario, the facilitator ensures that the "HarmonyLink" device provides supportive prompts, coping strategies, and messages of unity to the participants during the simulated wildfire smoke event in New York City. The facilitator also observes how participants respond to the prompts, engage with each other, and discuss their experiences during the feedback session. The goal is to assess the device's effectiveness in promoting emotional support, resilience, and community connection during the challenging event of wildfire smoke. The feedback gathered will help refine the "HarmonyLink" device to better meet users' needs in addressing the impacts of environmental challenges like wildfire smoke.

    <p><b>Insights from User Testing</b></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>The device's support does not align perfectly with their personal coping preferences. Especially around the timing of the therapeutic and group support.</li>
            <li>The perceived benefits do not justify the investment, especially if the user has other established methods for emotional support.</li>
            <li>The design and functionality of the device is unclear from the simulation. Why do you also need to use your phone? How are messages delivered?</li>
