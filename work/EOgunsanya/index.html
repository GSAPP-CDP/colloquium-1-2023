            <p>A system mapping of the housing search for people working in the informal economy in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>Journal Entry</h2>
            <p>
              An important question in my academic career has been “How can the Lagos State Government (LASG) effectively raise the living standards of its constituents and sustain economic growth without permanently displacing Lagos’ poorest residents?” After our first colloquium session, I have started to examine the current housing options for low-income denizens of Lagos as a collection of systems whose purposes include finding housing, providing housing, and regulating the housing market. The system I want to focus on right now is the one that identifies affordable housing in the Lagos metropolis for people who work in the informal economy or are a internally displaced due to conflict in other states. I am struggling a little bit to define the boundaries of this system, because it is not well documented and it feels so closely connected to the systems that involve relocating to Lagos for economic opportunities or safety, looking for housing as a worker in the formal economy, and luxury development.

          <div class="half">
            <p>There is little documented about this system but it seems to parallel the difficult searches undertaken by the working and middle class. Here is how some of the elements within this system interact. An individual, such as Stephanie Odili in a piece by Aljazeera, will meet with real estate agents to view the limited housing stock within their price range. At times the real estate agent will require a fee to show a space, which is illegal. The government does not enforce many of its housing-related laws. If a suitable place is found, a year’s worth of rent is needed to secure the lease. In a similar, but more enigmatic, way to New York City, a housing unit can rent out to someone else while you are still trying to secure it. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half"><p>The realtor pulling the rug from under you functions like a reinforcing feedback loop. One is sent back to square one or another option, finding a place to squat until one is evicted. This system is not resilient to economic and socio-political shocks. If and when luxury real estate developers decide that an informal settlement’s location is desirable, the government can evict the residents on the grounds of urban renewal. Housing security is also low when the already volatile economy is doing much worse, like it was during the Covid-19 pandemic. Landlords may choose to sell their land and properties and give tenants and squatters as little as one-day’s notice. If a resident loses their source of income due to government-mandated lockdowns, they can lose the right to occupy their housing unit once their lease-term is up.</p></div>

          <div class="full">
            <p>Given the amorphous nature of the process of finding housing as a member of the informal economy or an internally displaced person, it is difficult to identify exactly where the lock-ins lie. It is possible that the absence of public housing, the resulting reliance on the private housing market, and the custom of paying annual rent upfront can all act as lock-ins.</p>
            <p>Housing options are limited, rent payment options are limited, and more flexibility should be granted to those seeking housing. The circumstances of the lives of the future residents of informal settlements preclude them from access to the forms of technology that provide some form of accountability and access to information.</p>
              Landlords and realtors have too much flexibility within the system. They are at liberty to exploit prospective tenants because tenant laws are not enforced by a state government that relies on corruption to fatten the bellies of the leaders at nearly every level of seniority.</P>

            <p>My authorship philosophy is still in its infancy, but I do draw inspiration from Karp Strategies’ Virtual Toolkit for Public Engagement. They focus on leveraging technologies to center the needs, ideas, and desires of the community.</p>
            <p>I must (sheepishly) admit that I spent the past few days discussing AI and authorship outside of my system. My apologies, everyone! But do feel free to ask me about those thoughts too.</p>

          </div>

          <div class = "half">
            <p>After my first attempts to pin down a philosophy of authorship, I had the pleasure of discussing authorship with Kyungho Lee, Jonathan Marcos, and Elizabeth Singer. Our four different systems were linked by money and technology. More specifically, money and technology are acting as barriers that prevent specific communities from benefitting from these systems. We collaborated on a zine that presents a typical user journey in each system to highlight these barriers.

            <h2>My tentative authorship philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              Right now, my understanding of authorship in my system is that it is limited to those with access adn those in positions of power. This is true for many systems.
              Since my system is very fluid, I think there is room to change the rules surrounding authorship. They should be more inclusive. In moments like this, I like to look back at history to how pre-colonial societies defined authorship.I am omo Yoruba (literally translates to child of the Yoruba), a member of the Yoruba, a tribe indigenous to south west Nigeria, where Lagos is located. Our ancestors had a democratic monarchy in each of their city states. Yoruba people outside of the royal courts were still important voices of discussion about how each kingdom functioned. 
              </p>
              <div class="half">
                <p>    
              We had a bottom-up approach that highlighted the needs of the everyday person. In fact, one could only become a ruler after a successful public campaign against other eligible heirs. Of course, no human system is perfect, but the bottom up approach should be integral to authorship in my system.
              These waterfront informal settlements are older than the former British colony that is now the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In many ways these communities are still self-governing. These systems of governance are the foundation for the bottom-up processes for participatory planning in the creation of a new, more equitable system.
