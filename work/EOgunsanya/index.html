            <p>A system mapping of the housing search for people working in the informal economy in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>Journal Entry</h2>
            <p>
              An important question in my academic career has been “How can the Lagos State Government (LASG) effectively raise the living standards of its constituents and sustain economic growth without permanently displacing Lagos’ poorest residents?” After our first colloquium session, I have started to examine the current housing options for low-income denizens of Lagos as a collection of systems whose purposes include finding housing, providing housing, and regulating the housing market. The system I want to focus on right now is the one that identifies affordable housing in the Lagos metropolis for people who work in the informal economy or are a internally displaced due to conflict in other states. I am struggling a little bit to define the boundaries of this system, because it is not well documented and it feels so closely connected to the systems that involve relocating to Lagos for economic opportunities or safety, looking for housing as a worker in the formal economy, and luxury development. 
          </div>

          <div class="half">

          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>There is little documented about this system but it seems to parallel the difficult searches undertaken by the working and middle class. Here is how some of the elements within this system interact. An individual, such as Stephanie Odili in a piece by Aljazeera, will meet with real estate agents to view the limited housing stock within their price range. At times the real estate agent will require a fee to show a space, which is illegal. The government does not enforce many of its housing-related laws. If a suitable place is found, a year’s worth of rent is needed to secure the lease. In a similar, but more enigmatic, way to New York City, a housing unit can rent out to someone else while you are still trying to secure it. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half"><p>The realtor pulling the rug from under you functions like a reinforcing feedback loop. One is sent back to square one or another option, finding a place to squat until one is evicted. This system is not resilient to economic and socio-political shocks. If and when luxury real estate developers decide that an informal settlement’s location is desirable, the government can evict the residents on the grounds of urban renewal. Housing security is also low when the already volatile economy is doing much worse, like it was during the Covid-19 pandemic. Landlords may choose to sell their land and properties and give tenants and squatters as little as one-day’s notice. If a resident loses their source of income due to government-mandated lockdowns, they can lose the right to occupy their housing unit once their lease-term is up.</p></div>

            <h2>First musings on a personal philosophy of authorship</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="full">
            <p>Given the amorphous nature of the process of finding housing as a member of the informal economy or an internally displaced person, it is difficult to identify exactly where the lock-ins lie. It is possible that the absence of public housing, the resulting reliance on the private housing market, and the custom of paying annual rent upfront can all act as lock-ins.</p>
            <p>Housing options are limited, rent payment options are limited, and more flexibility should be granted to those seeking housing. The circumstances of the lives of the future residents of informal settlements preclude them from access to the forms of technology that provide some form of accountability and access to information.</p>
              Landlords and realtors have too much flexibility within the system. They are at liberty to exploit prospective tenants because tenant laws are not enforced by a state government that relies on corruption to fatten the bellies of the leaders at nearly every level of seniority.</P>

          <div class = "half">
            <p>After my first attempts to pin down a philosophy of authorship, I had the pleasure of discussing authorship with Kyungho Lee, Jonathan Marcos, and Elizabeth Singer. Our four different systems were linked by money and technology. More specifically, money and technology are acting as barriers that prevent specific communities from benefitting from these systems. We collaborated on a zine that presents a typical user journey in each system to highlight these barriers.

            <h2>My tentative authorship philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              Right now, my understanding of authorship in my system is that it is limited to those with access adn those in positions of power. This is true for many systems.
              Since my system is very fluid, I think there is room to change the rules surrounding authorship. They should be more inclusive. In moments like this, I like to look back at history to how pre-colonial societies defined authorship.I am omo Yoruba (literally translates to child of the Yoruba), a member of the Yoruba, a tribe indigenous to south west Nigeria, where Lagos is located. Our ancestors had a democratic monarchy in each of their city states. Yoruba people outside of the royal courts were still important voices of discussion about how each kingdom functioned. 
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="half">
                <p>    
              We had a bottom-up approach that highlighted the needs of the everyday person. In fact, one could only become a ruler after a successful public campaign against other eligible heirs. Of course, no human system is perfect, but the bottom up approach should be integral to authorship in my system.
              These waterfront informal settlements are older than the former British colony that is now the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In many ways these communities are still self-governing. These systems of governance are the foundation for the bottom-up processes for participatory planning in the creation of a new, more equitable system.

              There is very limited data (scope and quantity) regarding the housing inequities in Lagos, especially regarding the lived experiences of low-income communities. My practice would necessitate collecting data in concert with the communities the data is coming from. The absence of critical housing, economic, and socio-political data in Lagos is an opportunity to redefine the way data is collected and used inside and outside of Africa. In general, data collection must be a coordinated effort that involves the stakeholders, allowing them to set the appropriate boundaries regarding what is collected and how it is used. They also need to have access to everything that is created using their data. I have seen the opposite happen so often in academic settings and I have been grappling with the implications of collecting data in non-profit settings (specifically public health, a sector I have experience in).

            <p>
              The city of the future is experiencing transformative changes, driven by new mobility options and shared public transport, with a notable focus on cycling and bike sharing in urban areas. These changes prioritize sustainable and eco-friendly transportation, aiming to reduce congestion and enhance overall livability.
              Dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure have become integral features of the urban landscape, encouraging more people to adopt cycling as a mode of transport. As a result, streets and urban spaces are being redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, reducing car dominance and promoting healthier lifestyles while lowering carbon emissions and improving air quality.
              Data collection from bikes and users plays a crucial role in optimizing traffic flow and enhancing the transportation system. Real-time data analysis helps identify high-demand areas, enabling city planners to make informed decisions about infrastructure improvements and resource allocation.
              While the idea of autonomous bicycles offers exciting possibilities for safety and accessibility, there are challenges in integrating them seamlessly with human-driven traffic and ensuring their reliability and security.
              Overall, achieving a sustainable and efficient cityscape involves balancing shared and individual transportation options while prioritizing safety and addressing data privacy concerns.
              The introduction of more bike lanes and reduced car usage in urban areas fosters vibrant street-level interactions and enables various activities and services. Pedestrian-friendly zones emerge, encouraging outdoor events, markets, and community gatherings. The quieter, less polluted environment attracts businesses to extend services outdoors, boosting the local economy. In regions with extreme climates, covered or climate-controlled bike lanes and pedestrian areas ensure year-round usability. Integration of bike sharing with public transport offers a sustainable last-mile solution. Overall, these changes enhance the city's livability, encourage multi-modal transportation, and create resilient urban spaces.

            <h2>Design Fiction:</h2>
            <p>
              A Day in the Life of a Cyclist in 2035
              In the year 2035, the cityscape has been transformed to prioritize cycling and outdoor activities. As the sun rises, Ava, a fitness enthusiast and environmental advocate, begins her day.
              Ava's smart home system gently wakes her up with a simulation of a sunrise, accompanied by a soft melody. After a quick breakfast, she prepares for her daily commute to work. She steps into her weather-adaptive cycling suit, a marvel of textile technology that adjusts its temperature and texture based on the weather conditions, ensuring she is always comfortable during her ride.
              She heads to the garage where her smart bike awaits. The bike, equipped with an AI-powered navigation system, has already planned the most efficient route to her workplace. The navigation system is designed specifically for cyclists, taking into account bike lanes, traffic conditions, and even the scenic value of the route.
