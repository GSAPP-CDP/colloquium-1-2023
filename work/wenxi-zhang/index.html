              Each year during graduation season, a significant amount of B1/B2 visa holders will come to visit.
              A specific similar travel pattern could be seen and catalyzed in a group, that parents travel overseas to visit F-1 students 
              for their graduation ceremony. New York is a world-renowned tourist city, and tourist places like Time Square,
              Statue of Liberty are commonly chosen. As a result, even for parents visiting from all other countries, 
              a system with purpose could be seen in this short-term travel process.

            <p>
              Who: This system shows a clear pattern in location, time, and overall experience.
              During summer time graduation season, a lot of F-1 students' parents will come to travel to New York and do a short-term visit,
              which is usually within a month. Elements: in this system involves international travel/locations (stay / tour) / transportation/food/shopping/photos.
              Purpose: In this system, the participants (parents) have a clear purpose which is to visit students and visit Manhattan NYC. 
              One feedback loop could be seen as how this specific tourist spends their one single day in NYC. 
              (They might speed up the tourist process or delay)

            </p>

            <p>
              Stocks would be the overall tourist and visiting experience, while inflow would be money and time spent, and the outflow would be photos and experiences.
              Frequency and delay is also included in this system. Frequency can be defined as a daily base of the tour, while delay can be defined as not visiting any place in one day.

              and how long to stay at one place. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The hierarchy in this system wouldn't be that obivious, but usually, the F-1 student will plan the overall trip and do the decision-making.
              Travel Boundaries will be inside NYC. Resilience in this specific system would be the amount of rest that this group needs and overall travel budgets.

              How do you author an experience? And how do you author a place? A visit to NYC, mediated by a model trained on massive amounts of media generated by millions of visits to NYC (66 million visited in 2019 alone) reveals patterns and limits in how places on a tourist’s itinerary are seen, experienced, and shared. Photos of NYC landmarks tend to look the same, and many visitors and residents likely have very similar experiences of sites like Times Square, but there are multitudes here, in the very same place, that may elude AI modeling – and they’re important.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each take on the ChatGPT-produced itinerary mirrors some of the limited avenues for authorship that tourists following an itinerary might face. What are all of the branching decision points within the very first prompt “Arrive in NYC”? What are the linguistic, class, racial, experiential intersections with what it means to “arrive” in a place that you’re visiting, especially one as complex as the city. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an algorithmic logic to traveling through NYC, and even more so by AI prompt. Sites have been made legible for selling and showing off the city for visitors for century, and they’re a vital part of what makes New York New York.

            </p>
            <p>
              I see generative AI as a powerful tool. Now the two main types of generative AI could output text or images. In my opinion, most of the time, conversations with generative AI this is just like situations in visual studios, which has no different than a designer searching for inspiration from online readings or glancing at design works from bechance. AI could provide more help with relevant research or image reference gathering and debugging. Sharing something from social media to friends doesn't mean having any authorship, even sharing with comments wouldn’t change the fact. The authorship inside this process is creating a comment or insight on a specific topic, not the video or image itself. As a result, directly posting outcomes from AI output doesn’t count as having ownership or authorship. AI currently could be hard to be seen as an independent creator. Generative Ai is more like a platform. For example, platforms like google, Behance or GitHub won't take the authorship of any context they provide. Thus, directly delivering outputs from AI doesn’t means authorship, it's more like a sharing process.

            </p>
            <p>
              The decision about when and how to use the AI is essential. These decisions may affect the definition of whether to have authorship or not. Retouch and redesigning the AI outcome means a certain amount of individual thinking process and creation. The debating middle point of retouching might happen when an individual is using AI for most of the working outcome and just has a subtle amount of change. After the retouch, the output will contain a certain amount of authorship, just like defining authorship in a collage. But the percentage of authorship really depends on different scenarios and specific examples.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having overall authorship means using generative AI just as a reference tool, no other clear visual or text representation of other people's copyright could be detected. The percentage of authorship in this topic really depends on what output we are looking at. Meanwhile, attribution and transparency need to take into consideration. But it's understandable when AI generates information and images, it's hard to really give references, not like collage art or noting references in a research paper.

              One significant  pain  point  for  tourists  visiting  New  York  City  is  the  discrepancy  between  the  advertised  and  actual  locations  of  tourist  attractions.  Advertisements  often  depict  attractions  as  being  conveniently  located  and  easily  accessible,  creating  an  expectation  that  they  are  within  close  proximity  to  each  other.  However,  the  reality  can  be  quite  different.  NYC  is  a  sprawling  metropolis,  and  attractions  can  be  spread  out  across  different  boroughs,  requiring  significant  travel  time  and  navigation  through  complex  public  transportation  systems.  This  discrepancy  can  lead  to  frustration,  wasted  time,  and  missed  opportunities  to  fully  experience  what  the  city  has  to  offer.  It  can  be  particularly  challenging  for  first-time  visitors  or  those  with  limited  time,  who  may  find  themselves  spending  more  time  in  transit  than  actually  enjoying  the  attractions.  This  issue  underscores  the  need  for  more  accurate  and  realistic  representation  of  locations  in  tourism  advertising.

            <p>Methods:</p>
            <p>
              1.Affordances of Location Data: The location data provides several affordances or action possibilities. Users can view detailed information about the location, obtain navigation instructions to reach the location, and view reviews and photos from other users who have visited the same location. These affordances allow users to interact with the location data in meaningful ways, enhancing their understanding and experience of the location.
              Affordances of Image Data: Similarly, the image data also offers a range of affordances. Users can view detailed information about the image, zoom in or out to see the image more clearly, swipe to view more images, share the image with others, or save the image for future reference. These affordances enable users to engage with the image data, enriching their visual experience and interaction with the content.
              2.Reliability: Location data according to tripadvisor and googlemap reviews. Image data comes from location based popular posts.
              3.Accessibility: Tourist reviews data are public, but getting personal narrative feedback is less accessible.
              4.Detail: Famous tourist places' reviews are more detailed, compared to small shops.
              5.Scalability: Depend on organizing data based on location or based on images.

            </p>

            <p>
              Quantitative data: The travel transportation times, destinations, and durations of stay of travelers, can be collected through online travel platforms and social media. The affordances of these data lie in their accuracy and scale, which can be used to identify patterns and trends in travel behavior. 

            </p>

            <p>
              Qualitative data: Feedback and comments from travelers, can be collected through interviews and online reviews. The affordances of these data lie in their ability to provide in-depth insights into the behaviors and motivations of travelers. By combining these two types of data, I can gain a more comprehensive understanding of travel patterns in NYC, thereby optimizing my system.

            <p>
              The city of the future is experiencing transformative changes, driven by new mobility options and shared public transport, with a notable focus on cycling and bike sharing in urban areas. These changes prioritize sustainable and eco-friendly transportation, aiming to reduce congestion and enhance overall livability.
              Dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure have become integral features of the urban landscape, encouraging more people to adopt cycling as a mode of transport. As a result, streets and urban spaces are being redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, reducing car dominance and promoting healthier lifestyles while lowering carbon emissions and improving air quality.
              Data collection from bikes and users plays a crucial role in optimizing traffic flow and enhancing the transportation system. Real-time data analysis helps identify high-demand areas, enabling city planners to make informed decisions about infrastructure improvements and resource allocation.
              While the idea of autonomous bicycles offers exciting possibilities for safety and accessibility, there are challenges in integrating them seamlessly with human-driven traffic and ensuring their reliability and security.
              Overall, achieving a sustainable and efficient cityscape involves balancing shared and individual transportation options while prioritizing safety and addressing data privacy concerns.
              The introduction of more bike lanes and reduced car usage in urban areas fosters vibrant street-level interactions and enables various activities and services. Pedestrian-friendly zones emerge, encouraging outdoor events, markets, and community gatherings. The quieter, less polluted environment attracts businesses to extend services outdoors, boosting the local economy. In regions with extreme climates, covered or climate-controlled bike lanes and pedestrian areas ensure year-round usability. Integration of bike sharing with public transport offers a sustainable last-mile solution. Overall, these changes enhance the city's livability, encourage multi-modal transportation, and create resilient urban spaces.

              A Day in the Life of a Cyclist in 2035
              In the year 2035, the cityscape has been transformed to prioritize cycling and outdoor activities. As the sun rises, Ava, a fitness enthusiast and environmental advocate, begins her day.
              Ava's smart home system gently wakes her up with a simulation of a sunrise, accompanied by a soft melody. After a quick breakfast, she prepares for her daily commute to work. She steps into her weather-adaptive cycling suit, a marvel of textile technology that adjusts its temperature and texture based on the weather conditions, ensuring she is always comfortable during her ride.
              She heads to the garage where her smart bike awaits. The bike, equipped with an AI-powered navigation system, has already planned the most efficient route to her workplace. The navigation system is designed specifically for cyclists, taking into account bike lanes, traffic conditions, and even the scenic value of the route. As Ava starts her journey, the city's infrastructure caters to her needs. The smart roads detect her presence and illuminate the bike lanes for better visibility. The city's weather control system, a network of weather modification drones, ensures a clear sky for cyclists, making rainy or snowy commutes a thing of the past.
              During her ride, Ava's bike also doubles as a fitness device. It tracks her vitals, the calories burned, and even her posture. The data syncs with her health profile in real-time, helping her meet her fitness goals.
              On her way, Ava passes through the city's green corridors, areas dedicated to outdoor activities. She sees groups of people engaged in yoga, running, and other forms of exercise. The city, once dominated by cars, is now a haven for cyclists and fitness enthusiasts.
              Ava's commute is not just a means of getting to work; it's a daily fitness routine, a way to connect with the city and a testament to how technology has seamlessly integrated cycling into everyday life. The city of 2035 is a city built for people like Ava, where technology, fitness, and sustainability intersect to create a healthier and more connected community.
