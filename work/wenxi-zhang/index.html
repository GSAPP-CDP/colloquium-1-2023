              Each year during graduation season, a significant amount of B1/B2 visa holders will come to visit.
              A specific similar travel pattern could be seen and catalyzed in a group, that parents travel overseas to visit F-1 students 
              for their graduation ceremony. New York is a world-renowned tourist city, and tourist places like Time Square,
              Statue of Liberty are commonly chosen. As a result, even for parents visiting from all other countries, 
              a system with purpose could be seen in this short-term travel process.

            <h2>Whom does it impact?</h2>

            <p>
              Who: This system shows a clear pattern in location, time, and overall experience.
              During summer time graduation season, a lot of F-1 students' parents will come to travel to New York and do a short-term visit,
              which is usually within a month. Elements: in this system involves international travel/locations (stay / tour) / transportation/food/shopping/photos.
              Purpose: In this system, the participants (parents) have a clear purpose which is to visit students and visit Manhattan NYC. 
              One feedback loop could be seen as how this specific tourist spends their one single day in NYC. 
              (They might speed up the tourist process or delay)

            </p>

            <p>
              Stocks would be the overall tourist and visiting experience, while inflow would be money and time spent, and the outflow would be photos and experiences.
              Frequency and delay is also included in this system. Frequency can be defined as a daily base of the tour, while delay can be defined as not visiting any place in one day.

            <h2>What are its leverage points?</h2>

            <p>
              Building on top of these, Leverage points are dependence that could influence the flow, in this situation, will be trip planning, transportation methods, 
              and how long to stay at one place. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The hierarchy in this system wouldn't be that obivious, but usually, the F-1 student will plan the overall trip and do the decision-making.
              Travel Boundaries will be inside NYC. Resilience in this specific system would be the amount of rest that this group needs and overall travel budgets.

              How do you author an experience? And how do you author a place? A visit to NYC, mediated by a model trained on massive amounts of media generated by millions of visits to NYC (66 million visited in 2019 alone) reveals patterns and limits in how places on a tourist’s itinerary are seen, experienced, and shared. Photos of NYC landmarks tend to look the same, and many visitors and residents likely have very similar experiences of sites like Times Square, but there are multitudes here, in the very same place, that may elude AI modeling – and they’re important.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each take on the ChatGPT-produced itinerary mirrors some of the limited avenues for authorship that tourists following an itinerary might face. What are all of the branching decision points within the very first prompt “Arrive in NYC”? What are the linguistic, class, racial, experiential intersections with what it means to “arrive” in a place that you’re visiting, especially one as complex as the city. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an algorithmic logic to traveling through NYC, and even more so by AI prompt. Sites have been made legible for selling and showing off the city for visitors for century, and they’re a vital part of what makes New York New York.

              Wenxi's Reading Response
            </p>
            <p>
              I see generative AI as a powerful tool. Now the two main types of generative AI could output text or images. In my opinion, most of the time, conversations with generative AI this is just like situations in visual studios, which has no different than a designer searching for inspiration from online readings or glancing at design works from bechance. AI could provide more help with relevant research or image reference gathering and debugging. Sharing something from social media to friends doesn't mean having any authorship, even sharing with comments wouldn’t change the fact. The authorship inside this process is creating a comment or insight on a specific topic, not the video or image itself. As a result, directly posting outcomes from AI output doesn’t count as having ownership or authorship. AI currently could be hard to be seen as an independent creator. Generative Ai is more like a platform. For example, platforms like google, Behance or GitHub won't take the authorship of any context they provide. Thus, directly delivering outputs from AI doesn’t means authorship, it's more like a sharing process.

            </p>
            <p>
              The decision about when and how to use the AI is essential. These decisions may affect the definition of whether to have authorship or not. Retouch and redesigning the AI outcome means a certain amount of individual thinking process and creation. The debating middle point of retouching might happen when an individual is using AI for most of the working outcome and just has a subtle amount of change. After the retouch, the output will contain a certain amount of authorship, just like defining authorship in a collage. But the percentage of authorship really depends on different scenarios and specific examples.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having overall authorship means using generative AI just as a reference tool, no other clear visual or text representation of other people's copyright could be detected. The percentage of authorship in this topic really depends on what output we are looking at. Meanwhile, attribution and transparency need to take into consideration. But it's understandable when AI generates information and images, it's hard to really give references, not like collage art or noting references in a research paper.
