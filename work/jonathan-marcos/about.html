            <b><h2>ABOUT:</h2></b>
            <p>Jonathan Marcos is currently a M.S. Computational Design Practices candidate at Columbia University, GSAPP and currently holds a B. Architecture degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Within his practice, Jonathan aspires to integrate trending technologies, fantastical exploration, subliminal scales and savvy visual representations in order to criticize and investigate ongoing societal, political and technological problems in present-day and future scenarios.</p>
            <p>During his time in Academia, Jonathan had the privilege of being a visiting Research Assistant at the Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology in Industry City, Jonathan worked alongside Joshua Draper and PhD candidate Fatima Javeed to add-on prototype smart-lighting and ventilation systems in Draper's ongoing Friendship Cabins project by developing various scripts and printing 3-D print modules. Jonathan also worked on an urban proposal to reduce urban sprawl in the Hudson Valley and a trash-infested pavilion during his time in the program. From this point, Jonathan realized his passion for computational tools within the Architectural design workflow, and proceeded to pursue his masters at GSAPP in order to further explore these emerging interests.</p>
            <p>Jonathan's work has been featured in many publications, such as Metropolis' 2023 edition of their Future100 series, where he was recognized as a top 25 Undergraduate Architecture student in the United States and Canada. Jonathan's works have also been featured in Reif Larsen's Institute for Small Cities institute in the FOCUS! Lab in Troy, NY and suckerpunchDAILY run by Abigail Cooper and Nathan Hume. Jonathan has also been a recipient of various merits and awards, including the Alpha Rho Chi medal, Pella Scholarship, 2022 NESEA Be the Future Scholarship and 2021 RPI SoA Most Comprehensive Portfolio caption.</p>
