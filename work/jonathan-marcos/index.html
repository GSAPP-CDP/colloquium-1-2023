            <p>Taking otherwise disposed food from restaurants to customers at an affordable price.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">

          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            
              ToGoodToGo is a company with a purpose to collaborate with various restaurants and 
              supermarkets in order to sell food at a significantly cheaper price than retail that 
              would otherwise go to waste at the end of the day. Primarily, ToGoodToGo runs on a complex 
              system that primarily focuses on the flow of food from elements of the restaurant and/or 
              supermarkets  to its customers. Typically, companies delay their availability of food on
              ToGoodToGo until an hour or two before closing to balance their retail income and waste.
            </p>

            <p>
              As soon as that time period strikes, food and offers are posted on the ToGoodToGo app, 
              showing their stock on how many leftover meals and packages are available before closing. 
              Individuals are then invited to reserve and pick up their meals, pay the reduced price and
              enjoy! However, the meals are left in mystery, so individuals would not immediately know
              what they're getting in the bag. 
            </p>

            <p> 
              However, this can be consequential in a few ways, especially
              when individuals with particular allergies end up receiving a random thing that they end up 
              getting an allergic reaction to. However, with ToGoodToGo's reviews dashboard, ToGoodToGo 
              gives customers an opportunity to participate in a feedback loop that allows for opportunities
              to make better adjustments in the future. 
            </p>

          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              Though ToGoodToGo's intention is to sell affordable food that would otherwise go to waste, 
              ToGoodToGo's app interface is disproportionately inaccessible to the group that would benefit 
              from reduced food fares the most: low-income and the homeless, due to these groups being the 
              most likely to not have a smartphone for use. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              ToGoodToGo also competes with higher-end food delivering applications such as UberEats and Grubhub, 
              as ToGoodToGo has it's uncertain mystery with what is received and that customers have to pick up 
              from the vending establishments, whereas UE and GH give the option for customers to get their food 
              delivered to their doorstep.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              On the other side of the spectrum, ToGoodToGo competes with government-run food banks, as food 
              banks would give out food to low-income individuals for free instead of at a price. With the 
              government also making food banks more approachable due to their congregations being at public 
              centers instead of restaurants, food banks are better advertised for individuals with 
              smartphones compared to ToGoodToGo.

            <h2>Hierarchy From the Creator to the User</h2>
            <p>How authorship is distributed in multiple levels in various companies</p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p><b>ToGoodToGo's Authorship</b></p>

            <p>
              ToGoodToGo is primarily locked into using its mobile application interface in order to 
              manage its orders. This interface's authorship is most likely inspired by other incumbent 
              food-delivery and ordering apps, such as GrubHub, DoorDash and UberEats. However, they 
              expand on the boundaries of their platforms, by catering discounted meals at certain time 
              slots (particularly before closing hours for vendors), but also subtract from these platforms 
              by disabling the privileges of choice in food and delivery. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The lock-in of using the mobile-interface allows for ToGoodToGo to have similar accessibility 
              compared to its mobile food-delivery counterparts, and especially helps it appeal to its primary 
              audience: young professionals and university students, as these groups are frequently on their 
              mobile devices and are also looking for good meals at an affordable price. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite such, ToGoodToGo has the opportunity to expand on this by thinking about other groups 
              that would desire affordable meals but with smaller access to mobile devices: homeless and low-income 
              individuals. Instead of only using an app, ToGoodToGo has the potential to use other means of 
              technology that its mobile-food competitors don't take advantage of: Kiosks and stations spread out 
              in front of places such as supermarkets and transportation centers. These kiosks would take the orders 
              in lieu of the apps and would allow those without phones to have the opportunity to take advantage of 
              ToGoodToGo's philosophy.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">

            <p>
              Though there's not really much content to create from ToGoodToGo, it does get advertised by various 
              influencers, especially on platforms that attract a young audience such as TikTok and Instagram Reels. 
              Of course, ToGoodToGo should get a certain % of revenue from these TikToks, but they also get free 
              advertisement in return. 
            </p>

            <p>
              There are various levels of authorship that happens within the ToGoodToGo interface. The user's authorship 
              primarily focuses on choosing which restaurant they want to order from, placing an order and picking it up 
              if the restaurant is available for purchases. Going lower, the vendors have more control, as they have the 
              ability to determine if their establishments are open to orders, making the orders for the customers, and 
              distributing their goods. Even lower, there's the developers behind TGTG, who are in charge of making sure 
              the app interface runs smoothly and goes through any bugs along the way.

            <p><b>Example Authorship 1: LEGO</b></p>

            <p>
              LEGO has a particularly interesting Authorship Model, as there are various levels of Authorship that 
              occur within the LEGO experience-- from the pieces themselves to the creators. On the bottom-most level, 
              LEGO has Authorship over the various collections of pieces it creates. From there, LEGO designers use 
              these lego pieces and create manuals on how to design certain sets. Afterward, those who buy the LEGO kits 
              are allowed to build from these given sets, but also are given the opportunity to have a level of 
              authorship as employed LEGO designers have by creating their own original lego designs instead of  
              following step-by-step instructions on given sets. 
            </p>

            <p>
              LEGO's lock-in on creating their foundation on their bricks is very beneficial, as it locks itself as 
              the most popular brick-based toy in the market. However, it has the opportunity to expand by creating 
              official applications to build LEGO sets from, so individuals can make specifications and speculate 
              on how many custom lego parts they need to get in order to create unique LEGO sets.

              <p><b>Example Authorship 2: Minecraft</b></p>
  
              <p>
                Minecraft has various levels of authorship within its game. In its bottom-most level, the game is 
                managed and created by developers that create the base libraries and components of the game, such as 
                the materials, worlds, etc. with profits coming from those who purchase Minecraft. From there, creators 
                can create and share Minecraft worlds, potentially making profit based on their builds. Creators can 
                also create multiplayer servers and gain income based on the difference between server traffic and costs. 
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Creators can even go as far as modding the game in order to do certain things beyond the given libraries 
                initially placed in Minecraft, making profits from the amount of downloads they get. Minecraft's authorship 
                model is structured like a tree: it can branch out in many ways that give others the opportunity to profit, 
                as long as the base payment of $26.95 is given to Minecraft (+ other royalties from bigger multiplayer 
                servers).

              <div class="half">
                <p><b>Example Authorship 3: Unreal Engine and EPIC GAMES Studios + associated works</b></p>
                <p>
                  Unreal Engine is a free software that allows individuals to create world-building projects and games based 
                  on prior modeling. The base level of authorship comes from the developers behind Unreal itself, loading 
                  it with the pre-built packages and libraries that users are eventually able to use in order to world-build. 
                  From there, users are also able to purchase certain pre-built packs in Unreal in order to have an easier 
                  time setting up their scenes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  When these scenes are done, developers and creators can use content from Unreal in order to create games, 
                  with notable Unreal-based games being Fortnite, Fall Guys, GTA, etc. These games would make a profit from 
                  their users, whether that comes from merchandise, streaming, or advertisement. Of course, some of this 
                  profit goes to Unreal. There are many different levels of authorship behind Unreal, but there are different 
                  levels that all mutually stack on top of one another in order to create a profit stream.

                  behind Library Renovation, to the system involved in American Money Bails. Each experience all explains
                  how economic and technological barriers prevent these systems from reaching out to potential groups that 
                  would otherwise majorly benefit from each respective systems' services.
