            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            <p>
              An application of systems theory I interact with on a regular basis is the synthesizer system that lives in my apartment. 
              This system is made up of prefabricated units called “modules” that can be assembled according to a musician’s particular interests. The function of their system will change depending on
               1) the initialization of modules into the system and 2) creative “patching” of signal across modules using removable 3.5mm cables. 
               Depending on a user’s disposition, the system could be used to create dance music, pop, soundscapes, foley effects for film … many possibilities here.
              </p>
            <p> 
              The system passes audio-rate signals from module to module. These are sounds that, if connected to a speaker, would be perceptible to a listener. 
              In addition, the system includes control : literally electricity within designated minimum and maximum parameters (typically -5v to +8v). 
              Control  (CV) are used to creatively alter the audio: its amount, its quality, its duration, etc. The “stock” of audio signals and control  alike can be purposely attenuated or amplified through resistor or gain circuits,
              but otherwise voltage drop-off between modules is negligible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              A typical synthesizer patch designates a flow from sound source, perhaps an oscillating wave whose frequency designates its pitch and whose amplitude gives it a volume. 
              This sound can be leveraged in myriad ways - filtering harmonics away to the fundamental tone, changing its behavior over time, or mixing multiple channels at different amplitudes 
              to simulate a space.
              </p> 
            <p>
              An interesting compositional tactic involves so-called generative musical techniques. By carefully arranging the flow of control  to ebb and flow durationally, 
              commonly with an element of chance or randomness, the parameters of the system will unfurl into different configurations over time. For instance, boolean logic can be introduced to change
               a rhythm or sequence of pitches once certain parameters are satisfied. Feedback loops give the effect of an instrument playing itself, and can expand the palette and creative potential 
               of a musician who may otherwise be performing alone.

            <p>
              In spite of my own experience as a working musician and ostensible “creative” (aka being screwed left and right out of a reliable paycheck),
               digital authorship and ownership allows plenty of room for interpretation. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              Historically, visual artists and musicians have lifted techniques, motifs, and with the advent of accessible recording technologies, literally "sampled" others' work. 
              Typically the results are reinterpreted and obfuscated beyond easy recognition. I do this literally all the time. Sampling takes the concept of creative inspiration to its extremes, but I consider it a useful and deeply constructive creative methodology. To reduce a piece of art to its constituent parts then sculpt, stitch, rescale, and reframe them is a lovely way to lay a foundation for a new piece.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="half">
            <p>
              In my case, sampling is often at the sub-second scale, in which a small component block of audio or video can be looped or composited to recontextualize it into something ... new. 
              I have very distractingly excerpted some of my video work. Both clips are almost exclusively comprised of samples, the top from the work of Aldo Tambellini, Peter Tscherkassky, and Frans Zwartjes. 
              The clip to the right is processed and animated imagery from the University of California's public-domain Cell Image Library. Both are reconfigured,  processed, and montaged into what I would describe as a novel form.
            </p>
            <p>
              If one were to ignore the legal grounds of intellectual property disputes, which frankly do not interest me, where lies the line between inspiration and creative bankruptcy? 
              After all, who isn’t guilty of riffing on another writer’s voice after finishing their book? Imitation is a natural and adaptive human tendency. 
              I tend towards the the free sharing cultural media in the interest of accessibility and preservation, and against what the kids call “gatekeeping.” See: archive.org.
              Am I the “Digital Maoist” that Jaron Lanier dismisses? Probably. Does this encourage continued financial exploitation of artists by publishing houses? Let's explore this later!
              <!-- Two intractable pivot points of are profitability and scale. More on this later?            -->

              I might anthropomorphize the massive, indiscriminate act of training a neural network to the passive continuous act of taking inspiration from one’s daily life. 
               Lanier differentiates between the human experience and machine intelligence. Humans navigate the world in a manner of continuous sensation and perception, 
              experiencing growth and finding inspiration linearly in sequence.
              Computers have come to do this asynchronously and indiscriminately. 
              I take most offense to this general lack of intentionality in the training process. 
              A person seeks inspiration for production; a network of machines consumes content for reproduction. Yeah, corny, but that’s the sublime for you!
            </p>
            <p>Regarding Alberto Romero’s plaintive cries to keep calm and carry on…  I am at best skeptical of most editorial tech writing in a post-SEO internet. 
              I interpret blogs like Mr. Romero’s as largely advertorial, written in uncanny linkedin-coded one-liners. 
              Considering the inevitable profit motive involved when writing about one’s own profession, it makes sense. 
              Still, I guess the convergent evolution taking place between cynics, skeptics, and 🤯-emoji practitioners could give us pause.
            </p>
            <p>Should it be concerning that guys speculating - speculating in the editorial sense and, crucially, the financial sense - on the future of artificial intelligence sound stressed? Maybe. 
              The drama is irresistible, though, considering decades of science fiction precedent.

              A unstructured data search is a fun activity, and also deeply distracting. It’s an infinite treasure hunt. There’s a lot out there, and most of it is pretty interesting. Searching with the suffix “open source” leads to many labors of love, dead and alive, with passionate adherents (dead or alive?). Also of particular note… data graveyards. A hopeful click, then desolation. Miles of broken links. Something’s got to give.

              Grant disbursement data was best structured and most easily accessible on only a few borough-specific nonprofits’ sites. The Brooklyn Arts Council and New York Foundation for the Arts clearly and specifically named grant recipients and their benefactors.

              There is an interesting symmetry between the monopolistic corporate behemoths and hyper-niche special-interest platforms. The sheer amount of specialized user data in their orbit affords very granular, scalable inspection. Some of this is eminently scrapeable (in the case of wiki-like community aggregators like Modulargrid) or otherwise accessible through an API (e.g. Spotify).

              I had more trouble with the middle of the pack. Sites that are nominally commercial but swimming in a decidedly shallower pool of venture capital. ResidentAdvisor (rave curation/news/ticketing club-catchall platform) and Letterboxd (semi-amateur social film critique proving ground) come to mind. These sites are most likely to paywall most of the useful stuff for developers.

              I found myself drawn to data with discrete, preconfigured coding schemes (i.e. json-friendly integers) that enable easy-peasey quantitative analysis. This belies the importance of qualities that aren’t easily reducible to numbers and may conceal misleading, nefarious, or simply lazy translation of complex phenomena into dashboard-ready metrics. That said, quantification does open the door to easy interoperability. Free and open (or at least unimpeded) data streams facilitate the creative application of that data.
