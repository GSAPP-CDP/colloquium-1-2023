                <p>I am trying to make sense of the present through criticality and experimentation, using the models and tools of the present. My aim is to understand the limits of our reality — our models and perceptions — and to explore beyond these event horizons.

                <p>As I strive to understand the present — viewing it as a complex system composed of various interconnected scales and layers — I've ventured to experiment across scales, from macro to micro.

                    I’ve been investigating the Rare Earth Metals, those elements were presumed to be rare and are integrated into our everyday life, enabling both the hardware and the software of contemporary life and potential sustainable futures.
                    
                    My explorations spiral around the paradox inherent of these elements, not only in terms of occurrence but also in terms of effect. REE’s represent our fractured reality and duality of the presence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-field">
                <p>These elements, shrouded in the mysteries of their mining and supply chain processes, can enhance innovation and progress on all scales - its incentives and externalities effect and harm both the environment and humans. 

                    To me, the REEs symbolize a holistic, system-wide or atomic understaing. They've given rise to 'rock-based technologies', from computer chips to satellites. Such advancements don't just enable the way for more REE extraction; they also enable us to monitor and comprehend the very impact these elements have on our planet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-field">
                <p>I’m facsinated by the complexity of today's world and how change and innovation can enable transformative potential in one system cascade, allowing for emergent or even evolutionary properties across various scales. These range from planetary systems and technologies, to infrastructure and the built environment, including energy systems, data infrastructure, mobility, governance, policy systems, DAOs, and decentralized systems. Furthermore, they encompass systems of economy and finance, such as the circular economy, supply chains, and cryptocurrencies, extending to systems of thought, knowledge, and epistemologies. </p>

            <div class="text-field">
                <p>In essence, my pursuit revolves around dissecting, understanding, and reimagining systems. Whether it's the technologies we use or the philosophies we adopt, every piece offers transformative potential. By delving into the intricacies of our world, I hope to uncover insights that can pave the way for a viable future.</p>

    "What I would like to explore next: Storytelling & Gaming Engines: Storytelling is a powerful tool to convey complex ideas, and gaming engines provide a dynamic platform for this. Worldbuilding in games can be used to simulate and explore possible futures, making abstract concepts tangible.

    Speculative Design: This is a design practice that envisions alternative futures. It's about imagining and creating scenarios that challenge our current understanding of the world.
    
    Climate Change, Risk Assessment & Impact Analysis: Understanding the risks and impacts of climate change is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its effects, especially in vulnerable regions.
    
    Biology & Synthetic Biology: While biology studies life and its processes, synthetic biology aims to redesign and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems.
    
    Intelligence & Agent-based Models: Intelligence is a vast field, and agent-based models offer a way to simulate the behavior of individual agents (like animals or humans) and observe emergent patterns and behaviors in the system.
    
    Emergent Behavior & Generative Design: Emergent behavior arises when individual components interact, leading to unexpected patterns at a higher level. Generative design uses algorithms to generate a wide variety of design options based on set parameters.
    
    Systems Thinking: This is an approach that views things holistically, understanding how parts of a system interrelate and how they work over time within the context of larger systems.
    
    DAOs & Blockchain: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are organizations that are run through rules encoded as computer programs on a blockchain.
    
    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): HCI studies the design and use of computer technology, focusing on the interfaces between people and computers.
    
    Models & Tools: As technology evolves, so do our tools and models, which help us understand and navigate the complexities of our world."
