            <h2>NYC Transportation System</h2>
            <p>
              The spatial system I am interested in now is city transportation system. It fascinates me not only because I am involved with it, but also due to the pivotal role it plays in city operations and people’s lives. There are lots of elements in NYC transportation system, including webs of roads, vehicles, pedestrians, public transportation and signals. These elements are nested together to achieve the purpose, which is enabling people and goods to move through the city.
The dynamics of this system are feedback loops. The reinforcing loop involves traffic congestion. As congestion intensifies, people are more inclined to use public transportation, which in return, potentially alleviates the congestion and increase efficiency of system. The balancing loop is the increase in car usage. In this case, the stock is filled with more vehicles, which possibly decreases the efficiency. 

The feedback loops in city transportation system operate with a certain frequency and delay. For instance, decisions to alter modes of transportation might not yield immediate effects due to adjustment time.

              The leverage points in NYC transportation system could be the establishment of traffic regulations or public transportation infrastructures, including metros, buses, shared-bikes. Manipulating these leverage could modify the system’s behaviour.

This system has distinct hierarchy, from individual commuter to one community, to the whole city, which provides different levels of understanding and analysis of transportation issues. 

The most challenging part to understand and analyze this system is its dynamics and complex nature. The challenge is how to adjust system elements and leverage points to enhance the service provided to people, thereby improving resilience of systems, ensuring that it can maintain its function even under pressure like population serge or holiday peaks.

            <h2>Considering authors in my system</h2>

            <p>
              In the practice of NYC Transportation System, different stakeholders possess varying degrees of authorship, each of them should have some levels of lock-in and flexibility of technology used in this system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, city planners and engineers are program authors, who might hold the maximum authorship in this system. They are professionals in charge of designing and maintaining the transportation system, such as mapping routes, constructing traffic facilities, formulating and implementing transportation policies. For instance, they might decide where to set up new metro routes and interval time for each train, thereby to some extent shaping the city’s transportation network. They must think very carefully in advance, ensuring plans are effective for all users and the future, which is their “lock-in” aspect of authorship.
            </p>

            <p>
              Secondly, drivers and passengers, as the user author, should also have authorship. They have the right to choose their modes of travel, routes, and customize setting in the “locked-in” transportation systems or user interface Apps developed by programmers. For example, a passenger might choose whether taking metros or taxi on google map, and if they choose to take taxi, they will turn to Uber on their mobile. Here, the “flexibility” aspect of authorship is that users can make choices on these user interface based on their time, cost, comfort and other factors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Government stakeholders should also hold a certain level of authorship. The government has the responsibility to supervise the overall operation of NYC Transportation System, ensuring safety, efficiency and fairness. For instance, they have power to control the system by legislating laws such as setting speed limits or penalties for drunk driving. Moreover, government always keep transportation data and have authorship to give data to other companies like Google. 
            </p>

            <p>
              In this system, AI can, in certain circumstances, be considered an 'author'. For example, software developers in transportation systems now use AI algorithms to optimize traffic flow, predict traffic patterns, and to an extent 'write' traffic rules. In these instances, the AI's 'lock-in' function is its ability to make predictions and optimizations, providing a powerful and flexible tool for urban traffic management.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, AI can also play a role in user interfaces (UI), providing personalized user experiences. For instance, AI could learn from user behavior patterns, predict their needs, and offer personalized traffic recommendations. In this case, the 'flexibility' of AI lies in its personalized services, which is also a form of 'authorship'.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, within the practice of this system, all stakeholders, including city planners, engineers, app developers, users, the government, should have a certain degree of authorship. Such a design ensures that the system has robust professional guidance, caters to user customization needs, resulting in an efficient, user-friendly system.

              In the exploration of New York City’s public transit system, the essence of the practice is rooted in the selection of datasets. I have downloaded  geojson data of NYC subway lines and all their stations, complemented with the geographical layouts of NYC museums, parks, individual landmarks, and WiFi hotspots distribution.
            </p>

            <p>
              The synthesized map illuminated the city's transit accessibility, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between subway stations and their proximity to cultural landmark, green spaces, and Internet connectivity points. Indeed, many of the city's landmarks, museums, and parks are conveniently located near subway nodes, a testament to the city's urban planning vision.

              However, the datasets is also limited and biased: factors such as actual subway travel times, train frequencies, and crowd density weren’t explicitly depicted. There's an inherent politics to our data. For instance, the distribution of WiFi hotspots may echo commercial interests or policy preferences.
            </p>

            <p>
              While the overarching subway data offers a macroscopic view, the detailed locations of landmarks provide a granular perspective. These datasets  collectively sketch a dynamic and multifaceted portrait of NYC’s transit ecosystem. Yet, there’s room for enhancement. To bridge the gaps in the future, I am supposed to analyze and incorporate more kinds of datasets like user interviews, surveys and anonymous questionaires, or even sensor deployments to refine the understanding of the system.
